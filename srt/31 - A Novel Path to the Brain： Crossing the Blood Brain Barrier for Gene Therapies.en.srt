1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Our next speaker um is Dr. Andrew uh

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,200
Seinapper who's coming to us to speak

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,559
about novel a novel path to the brain

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,759
crossing the bloodb brain barrier for

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,679
gene therapy. As Dr. Wilson alluded to,

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,920
you know, we don't stop. So it's

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,119
important as we advance genetic

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,480
medicines for Angelmen syndrome. We

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,160
don't just stop and say, well, this is

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,119
it. If this doesn't work, nothing else

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,920
will. We have to ensure that we have

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,519
options coming behind. For every version

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
one, there's a version two. and for

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,600
every version two there's a version

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,160
three. And as we think about that and we

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
think about the the transformation of

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,079
science, we have to keep up with the

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,280
science. And this is something that

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,680
still is in somewhat early stages. We

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,600
don't have evidence or data really in

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,920
humans as it relates to these new type

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
of capsids, but it is what's upcoming

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,640
and we are going to see over the coming

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,719
years a lot of new activity in this

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,239
space. And so I invited Andrew to come

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,600
and speak to us about the incredible

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,920
work that him and his team have been

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,840
doing at Apertura, who have been a a

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,240
really great team engaging and embracing

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,680
rare disease parents and families and

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,840
organizations to ensure that all

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,960
advocacy groups have access. They have

33
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,880
access to new technology and money and

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,360
time and availability does not become

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,759
their barrier. And so Andrew has really

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,000
been quite impressive as it relates to

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,159
his communication and engagement with

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,560
communities, particularly this one. So

39
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,560
Andrew, please.

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,159
>> Thank you so much, Allison, and it's um

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
truly an honor to get to be here and

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,960
especially following a very tough set of

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
acts. Um as Allison noted, my name is

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,640
Andrew Steinapper. Um I help lead

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,920
Apertura gene therapy. Um, I have a day

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,439
job. I work at a company called

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,880
Deerfield Management. We do healthcare

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,399
investing. Um, our motto is advancing

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,520
health care. And I've always tried to

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,119
add the kod on to that of sometimes one

51
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,439
patient at a time. What we did is help

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,280
start a company called Apertura Gene

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,479
Therapy. And we said, we know the

54
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,680
problems because the leaders in the

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
field have been calling them out for

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,120
years. We need to understand how to

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,720
build tools, in this case AEV, that will

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
work, that can move forward and make

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,599
life easier for what we're doing. And

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,840
what we wanted to do is start with that

61
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,400
end in mind. Not the first patient that

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,200
gets a drug, but rather the thousandth

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,440
patient in commercial that gets that

64
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,120
drug because it's already been approved.

65
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,720
So what we did was we said we want to

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
use the science that we understand, what

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,440
we've learned in antibodies, what we've

68
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,800
learned in other drugs and start with

69
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,239
the receptors, the things that we

70
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,959
target, the things that help us get to

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,640
where we're going and leverage those. We

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
are standing on the shoulders of giants

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,560
including our scientific founder Ben

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,599
Deman who has started all this work and

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
is the reason why we've moved this

76
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,519
forward not just on the science but also

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,080
in the purpose of making sure that

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,239
everyone has access to what we have

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
because we alone cannot do everything.

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,720
It is only when we are together that we

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,720
are the smartest and the most capable.

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,959
So with that and I think we we had some

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,120
explanations of what AEV is and I was

84
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
told very specifically by Allison that

85
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
the people in this audience know more

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,760
about science than I ever will but

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,319
nonetheless I will make sure to have

88
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,200
this. I've always thought about AAV as

89
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,760
helping give a software update. As it

90
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,159
was noted earlier we we have viral genes

91
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,159
that we can take out. That's the stuff

92
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
on the left. And instead what we put in

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,599
is on the right. It's that new set of

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,640
instructions and AAV is really good at

95
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,959
going into cells and dropping off those

96
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
instructions so that they can be read.

97
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
Those instructions could be things like

98
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,720
how to make UB3A. They could be

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,959
instructions like how to do gene editing

100
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,799
or other things. And because we're able

101
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
to drop it off and it can hang out and

102
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,440
be in the cell, we don't have to keep

103
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,120
redossing this. Now, with that, we have

104
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,560
all of these opportunities that we can

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
address. The question is, why aren't we

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,200
already doing it? Part of the reason why

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,439
we're not doing is the things noted by

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,959
Jim and by Liz in the complexity of

109
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,680
moving these forward because certain

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,519
AAVs are better at different things. And

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,959
frankly, AAV that exists in nature,

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,879
which has been around for billions of

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,480
years and has never caused disease,

114
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,320
isn't really meant for gene therapy.

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,840
It's meant to be what it is.

116
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,400
Nonetheless, we've been able to find

117
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,040
through so much work and energy and time

118
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,440
which ones of these naturally occurring

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,440
AAVs can be used to get to certain

120
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,680
tissues, be those the central nervous

121
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,280
system or the liver or the eye or the

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,280
muscle. But really what we have been

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,199
doing is working with research tools and

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,080
trying to find the right ones that maybe

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,919
meet our needs. And with that, we need

126
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
that progress. It's important that we

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,479
continue that work and move it forward.

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,400
That's why there are drugs that are

129
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
approved. That's why there are more than

130
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,800
4,500 babies that have received Zulenma

131
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,160
for SMA1.

132
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
These things have changed the world and

133
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
they will continue to do so. What we're

134
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,960
hoping to do is help expand that

135
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,120
opportunity by building new capsids with

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,880
new capabilities that can help across

137
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
more diseases and make it easier to

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,199
administer those products and be able to

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
do it at lower doses for all of the

140
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,360
reasons that folks were talking about

141
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,440
earlier. And in a lot of ways, I think

142
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
that we've gotten there, at least in our

143
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,600
early research. The work that I'm

144
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,240
showing to you right now is a mouse

145
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
brain on the left in blue. And then on

146
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
the right is another mouse brain, but

147
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,000
one that received our first generation

148
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,759
capsid that uses the human transferin

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
receptor to cross the bloodb brain

150
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,639
barrier. I'll be telling you more about

151
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,039
that later, but the thing I want you to

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,960
see here is all those little green dots,

153
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,600
all those little green dots are software

154
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,600
updates. Those are cells that received

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
that virus. And if I had the other

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,199
slides that I had in here, but I have a

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
limit on the amount of time I have, I

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,160
would turn off the blue and you would

159
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,840
see just a green brain on that side. And

160
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,919
the reason that we're able to do that is

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,400
because we're using biology the way that

162
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,880
it was meant for. We're leveraging a

163
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,560
receptor called the transferin receptor.

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,360
The transferin receptor is named that

165
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
way because scientists are not creative.

166
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,479
The transferin receptor binds to

167
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,319
transferin, hence its name. What the

168
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,560
transferin receptor does normally is

169
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
help the body by grabbing on to

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,960
transferin which holds onto iron and

171
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,280
move it across the bloodb brain barrier.

172
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,199
Iron on its own hanging out would be

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
actually toxic. So our bodies put it

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
into this protein to help protect us.

175
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,880
Now that protein unfortunately is too

176
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,319
big to get in the brain and that's where

177
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,000
we actually need a lot of iron to make

178
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
energy. The same way that people say

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,560
that if you do a cross word puzzle you

180
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,840
don't have to run a mile because you're

181
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
burning a lot of calories. Although

182
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,360
jokes aside, I know doctors I still

183
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,039
should be running a mile. We need to get

184
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
it in there. So, we're leveraging the

185
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
same receptor that's normal job is to

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,639
help be a ferry to bring things across

187
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,560
to bring our virus across. And in fact,

188
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,639
this receptor has been used across

189
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,639
hundreds of patients, both pediatric

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,600
patients as well as geriatric patients

191
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,600
to help move other biomolecules across.

192
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,680
You heard Dr. Wilson talk about Hunter

193
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,360
syndrome a minute ago. There is a drug

194
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,360
that is approved that uses the human

195
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,440
transferin receptor to bring across the

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,599
medicine for Hunter syndrome for folks.

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
And that drug is approved in Japan. And

198
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,680
there are other things that are moving

199
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,599
forward from both JCR, Denali, and RO in

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
the US to do the same thing. Now, all of

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,520
those are doing biologics, those like an

202
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
enzyme. What we're doing instead is

203
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
saying we're going to use our virus to

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,560
do that because it also uses the same

205
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
receptor.

206
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,319
Now, with that, we think that that means

207
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
that we have an opportunity to help

208
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
across a number of disorders. And of

209
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,280
course, Angelman is on there, but it's

210
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,120
more than just that. It's all of these

211
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
diseases that we haven't heard of yet.

212
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,680
The ones that have five letters and two

213
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,840
numbers that maybe three people in

214
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
academia are researching. We think that

215
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,280
we have an opportunity to make sure that

216
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,880
those folks have access to this too and

217
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,039
that they can build upon this platform

218
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,560
like Jim was noting and being able to

219
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,319
consistently be able to move forward

220
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,280
because we're using the same tools to do

221
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,440
the same job over and over again.

222
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,280
For our work, we are progressing

223
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,440
actively with multiple rare disease

224
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,720
groups. We have one program that should

225
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,080
be in human trials at the end of 2026.

226
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,520
We have another that should be in human

227
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,560
clinical trials at the beginning of

228
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,840
2027. That's exciting. And honestly,

229
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
talking to all the folks in that

230
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,039
community and others, I know it's never

231
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,319
going to be fast enough. But the reason

232
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,440
it's taken this amount of time is

233
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,960
because we're making sure that we're

234
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,319
running the right experiments at the

235
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,759
right time in the right order that we

236
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,240
are not cutting corners but moving

237
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,479
forward correctly with that. And even

238
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,919
though we have oodles of safety data in

239
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,000
engaging with the human transparent

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,520
receptor for other drugs, it's never

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,280
been done with a virus, which is why

242
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,759
it's been important that we've executed

243
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,800
critical studies in non-human primates

244
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,039
and in mice to help understand how this

245
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,599
medicine can work. We're excited for

246
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,120
this to move forward. And it's really a

247
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,159
great pleasure for for me and a

248
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,360
privilege to say that our first

249
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
partnership was not with a a

250
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,279
therapeutics company, but rather with

251
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,120
the Rhett Syndrome Research Trust, an

252
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,640
organization like FAST that's devoted to

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,560
working for their patient advocacy

254
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,839
community to progress things. We've also

255
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,440
been able to work with a number of other

256
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,440
groups. And our goal is to actually make

257
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,200
sure that this is available across the

258
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
board for folks in academia developing

259
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,399
products as well as people in companies

260
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,920
and rare advocacy groups. And with that,

261
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,600
it wouldn't be a science talk if I

262
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,200
didn't show you data. You saw brains

263
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
earlier and this is the part that I'm

264
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
most excited about outside of answering

265
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,959
your questions after this because we

266
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,279
have a poster. But we are able to use

267
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:22,320
dose levels here that are 5050 times

268
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,920
lower than what are used in the

269
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,920
currently approved therapies for

270
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,880
introvenous administration. And even

271
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,720
when at that super duper low dose level

272
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,839
we're reaching almost all of the cells

273
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,680
in the brain. What you see here is AV9

274
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
which doesn't work really IV very

275
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,080
efficiently in adult mice. Then you see

276
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,279
a capsid that only works in mice which

277
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
it's not going to do anything for

278
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,120
people. And then you see our caps at

279
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
TFR1 capex that uses that human

280
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,040
transparent receptor to cross that

281
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,760
bloodb brain barrier. And to that point

282
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,600
of looking at other tissues and how that

283
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,360
virus goes to different places, the

284
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,760
thing that's so exciting for us and that

285
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,000
you can see here in that pink magenta is

286
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,320
that at these doses we're getting about

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,880
the same amount of virus into the brain

288
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,360
into the CNS as we are getting into the

289
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,440
liver bringing it into par rather than

290
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,279
what we've seen with other standard

291
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,600
capsids in this first generation of

292
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,600
technologies where that ratio is 100 to

293
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
one or a thousand to one. What that

294
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
means as we think about this is that not

295
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,920
only are we able to address this with a

296
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,839
much lower dose, but the places that

297
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,720
we're going are closer to where we want

298
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,640
them to be for both neurological

299
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,560
disorders and neuromabolic disorders.

300
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,240
What we've done here is not just to say

301
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,000
we're going to build a tool and then not

302
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
use it. We've also been progressing

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
internal programs. We've been

304
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,279
collaborating with others and we

305
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,880
recognize that it is not just up to us

306
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
to move these things forward. The first

307
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,000
thing that we want to do in every case

308
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
is to sit down with the patient advocacy

309
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
communities and understand what the

310
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,959
needs are because the stakeholders in

311
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,200
the room are the people that are going

312
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,760
to actually use those drugs. And that's

313
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
why it's important that it's everyone in

314
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,880
here that feels comfortable with the

315
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,279
data that is generated because it's not

316
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,959
just what the FDA says okay to. It's not

317
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,240
just what the doctors say okay to. It's

318
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,040
also understanding these things. And

319
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,040
it's wonderful to see such great

320
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640
presentations explaining everything like

321
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,399
you saw earlier so that everyone

322
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,079
understands what's moving forward.

323
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,000
Nonetheless, with that in our programs

324
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,079
that we've been moving forward for TSC,

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,480
another uh genetic disorder as well as

326
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,000
for pryion disease with sonia valib, we

327
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
have already got an alignment on those

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,600
programs with the FDA for what our path

329
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,279
forward is. And that's a path forward

330
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,440
where we can use these mice that have

331
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,440
the human transferin receptor knocked

332
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
into them and use them as the direct

333
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,360
model for human dosing because it has

334
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,279
the exact same receptor and that drug

335
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
interacts exactly in the same way and

336
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,440
helps it has predictable dose levels

337
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
across the board. With that, we've also

338
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,279
been able to help make sure that the

339
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,200
data that already exists, the research

340
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,360
that's already been done doesn't need to

341
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,760
be done over again and instead we can

342
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,079
continue to leverage those data as folks

343
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,640
transition over to this capsit. So all

344
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,640
of that time, effort, and labor isn't

345
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,040
wasted, but rather something that can be

346
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,279
built upon to move forward to second

347
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,440
generation products for [snorts]

348
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,240
patients and communities. And we've made

349
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,720
sure to put out our uh blueprints and

350
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
road maps in public forums like this one

351
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,920
so that these slides are all available

352
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,680
without confidentiality and without

353
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,360
needing to have an agreement. So that

354
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,120
not just patient advocacy groups and

355
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,959
parents trying to progress programs, but

356
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
also academics out there that want to be

357
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,560
helping and want to be moving forward,

358
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,639
but don't have the years and decades of

359
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,480
experience, someone like Jim on how to

360
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
progress a program can get that

361
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,079
explainer guide and so that we can be

362
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,040
there to help them think through that.

363
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:39,120
as I thank you. Um, with that like I

364
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
think it's important to note as we

365
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
progress through programs that there are

366
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,200
going to be challenges and setbacks and

367
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,760
it's important to us as we do this that

368
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,360
we are continuously transparent and we

369
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
share those data and help make sure that

370
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
everyone has access because it is only

371
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,079
through all of us learning together that

372
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
we're able to progress this many

373
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,200
programs. I have to have a huge thank

374
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
you to Allison, the team for this

375
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
opportunity and also Allison realizing

376
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,839
these are my old slides where I had like

377
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,959
27 slides and you said you wouldn't I

378
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,920
wouldn't be able to get through them in

379
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,360
time. So, um I don't want to go through

380
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,440
all those and and blow up your time

381
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
frame, but I I do want to just end on

382
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,160
our thank you slide rather than talking

383
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,760
through Pryion, which is really exciting

384
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
and come talk to me afterwards. But

385
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
truly, the thing that we're here for is

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,320
to try to make sure there's not just a

387
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,839
next generation of gene therapy, but of

388
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
collaboration across the board in the

389
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,800
rare disease space. One of my mentors

390
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,320
said to me, "It's not which disease I

391
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,200
want to work on, it's the question of

392
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,200
why not that one too." And I look

393
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
forward to the day where more people are

394
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
sharing that. And we are going to do

395
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
everything we can in our power to make

396
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,279
sure that this technology is available

397
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,069
to foundations like FAST and many

398
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,089
others. Thank you so much.

399
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,089
[applause]

400
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,880
>> Thank you, Andrew. Thank you, Andrew.

401
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,720
That was great. And I think everyone can

402
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,720
see as we move things forward, the

403
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,000
technology is changing. And you know,

404
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,760
we're very excited. We're going to hang

405
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,320
on tight to see that first patient

406
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,320
that's dosed hopefully in 2026 and how

407
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,680
that can impact rare disease in general,

408
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,680
particularly neurologic disorders.
