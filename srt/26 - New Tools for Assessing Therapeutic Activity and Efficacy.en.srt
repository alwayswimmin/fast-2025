1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,040
Okay, our next speaker is going to be

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,960
talking to us about new tools for

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,160
assessing the therapeutic activity and

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,000
efficacy for Angelmen syndrome. And I

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,360
believe that we actually have Lena Han

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,759
who's going to be presenting on behalf

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,120
of Albert Young, who I assume is not

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,320
here. Otherwise, you wouldn't be

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,840
standing up and walking here. Or you've

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,760
grown a lot of hair and you've shrunk a

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,960
little bit and you look like a different

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,720
person. Come on up.

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,720
Because that's not Albert that I'm sure

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,720
of.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,520
Hello everyone. Uh today I'd like to be

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,320
here to share some results from uh four

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,120
projects from our group and our

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,039
collaborators on new tools for assessing

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,039
therapeutic activity and efficacy.

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,239
So

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:59,039
uh first uh our group generated a human

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,600
and syndrome class 2 reporter cell line

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,920
by integrating a green floren center

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,320
protein gene into the genome and this uh

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,200
reporter cell line can be used for

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:19,040
therapeutic screening. Uh so when the uh

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:22,400
paternal UV3 is anti uh is uh inactive

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,680
the cell is dark but after we add the

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,479
drug if the drug is effective uh when

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,079
the drug restore the expression of

31
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,600
paternal UV3A then the cells turning

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,479
green uh light up green. So the reporter

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,360
signal can be uh observed on the

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,320
microscope or be analyzed by

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,600
flowcytometry directly. No antibbody

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,920
needed. Uh this work just published

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,000
recently.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,759
Uh second,

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,520
a desirable tool to detect UV3 bio

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,640
activity is highly uh desirable for both

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,000
potency and biomarker essay uh in

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,000
therapeutics evaluation and disease

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,599
monitoring. Our group developed this uh

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,239
rapid and highly sensitive essay that

45
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:21,920
can be detect functional UV3 B activity

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:26,319
with one or more sensitivity and it can

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,920
discriminate while type U3 with mutant.

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,720
Uh

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,879
we also successfully applied this essay

50
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,400
for uh multiple different biological

51
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:44,080
samples including uh human stem cell

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:47,280
lysate uh cell culture supernent and

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,000
recombinant cell penetrating peptide

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,040
UV3A.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Uh this work uh published earlier this

56
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,720
year.

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,879
We also developed a scalable uh oops

58
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,400
we also developed a scalable

59
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,720
electrophysiology

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:13,040
platform by using macro electro

61
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:17,040
electrode aris. uh each basket shaped

62
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,680
MEA can hold one organoid and it

63
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,319
contains 12 independent

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,560
uh macro electrodes that can

65
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,840
confformally interface with the

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,640
organoid. This platform can be used for

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,440
high throughput brain activity recording

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,840
and drug screening. The right side

69
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:42,319
figure uh is a plot uh recordings the

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,680
voltage recordings of 74 organoids human

71
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,760
organoids uh in parallel which is the

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:54,519
largest data set uh reported to date for

73
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,519
the organoid electro psychology.

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,000
At last we also um analyzed the role of

75
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,599
UB3A

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,040
in human cerebral organoids by using

77
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,560
single cell RNA sequencing with H9 wild

78
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,320
type and H9 double knockout UB3A

79
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:20,799
organoids. Uh our results reveal absence

80
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:25,120
of UV3A might affect multiple cell types

81
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,080
not only the neurons and also uh affect

82
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:31,919
the developmental processes in human

83
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,919
cerebral organoids uh including cell

84
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:40,320
type compositions cell proliferations

85
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,080
uh organoid uh size and cortical

86
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,800
development.

87
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,880
Uh I'd be happy to take any questions in

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,919
the following poster session. Thank you

89
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,919
all for your time and listening.
