1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
And then our last talk before we get to

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,640
vote is Dr. Joel Matthews who's

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,519
presenting something quite similar an

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,760
update on Angelman syndrome uh CSF UV3

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,760
as a biioarker.

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,640
So I'm the last one to keep you away

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,840
from um post recession and cocktails and

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
all those sort of things. So I'll try to

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,440
go fast. So um as Allison said, yes,

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,840
I'll be speaking very similar. So we um

11
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,160
with Biogen had developed a different

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,960
assay that also measured UB3A within

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,800
CSF. Um I should say I'm an employee of

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,200
Ionis.

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,039
Um and so but before I jump into that, I

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,120
want to just really we today we've been

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
talking a lot about biomarkers. Um

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
there's been in several different talks

19
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,920
people have mentioned them. But why as

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,600
as drug developers and and people do we

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,520
care about biomarkers? What what do they

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,040
do? What do they provide? Um so I can't

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
even see what's up on there. Um so

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,159
biomarkers um we like to classify them

25
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,640
into four different categories. Um the

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,159
first one is diagnostic and you can

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,720
think about these as how these will help

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,479
you to know what's going on inside your

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
body if you have a certain disease or

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,320
something. um pharmmodynamic or disease.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,000
Um these are where we work a lot um as a

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,799
biomeic scientist and trying to discover

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
these type of um assays and and markers

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,280
that we can measure. So we can know if

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,880
if our medicine that we're giving um

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,720
that we're testing is actually working

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,640
and if it's hitting the cells that going

38
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
to the cells that we want it to go to

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
and is it changing the organs in the way

40
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,720
that we think is productive. And there's

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,880
also prognostic biomarkers. These are

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,280
ones that predict how your condition may

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
change over time. for instance, if your

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,240
disease is going to be fast or slow

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,640
progressing

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,479
um or safety biomarkers basically learn

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,479
how to track what's happening with your

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,079
your therapy inside your body. So um in

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
this context as we said we have

50
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,040
developed an assay for measuring UB3A um

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,599
is as a tool to help in our clinical

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,520
developments. Um, and with your guys'

53
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,040
help, we've been able to use samples

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
that we've gotten from some natural

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,959
history trials to try to start

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
characterizing our assay and

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
understanding some of the

58
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,599
characteristics about it um to

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,160
understand its usefulness within the

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,800
clinical trial. And so the first one we

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,920
have here on the um my left, I don't

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,080
Yeah, your guys left too. um is where we

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,239
took samples and we ran them in the

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,360
assay multiple times to see what the

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,120
variability is within that assay. Um to

66
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,879
be able to quantify a sample um a

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,280
biomarker, you need to have good

68
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,560
reproducibility between um different

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,400
batches. And now with UB3A, because it's

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
expressed in every cell in the body,

71
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,239
you'll see there's a couple ones on here

72
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,040
that have that are highlighted in in

73
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,680
red. Um these are ones that there was

74
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,319
the CSF samples were actually had red

75
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
blood cells in them as sometimes happens

76
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,400
in collection. Um but because red blood

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,080
cells and other cells types that come

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,159
from blood contain UB3A within them um

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
these ones had higher levels and so they

80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,239
weren't used for calculating

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
reproducibility. The other thing we did

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
um here on the right is you can see

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
where we also as part of one of our

84
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,879
natural history trials we did we were

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,599
able to get CSF samples from two time

86
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,720
points where um and then we could

87
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,879
compare how UB38 is varying over time

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
within an individual

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,720
um and you can look at the bottom to see

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,959
the statistics for that. The other thing

91
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,200
we've done is we've also um tried to

92
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,360
understand what is the source of that

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,640
CSF um UB3A as um was talked about

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,040
before um there um UB3A is expressed in

95
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,879
every cell type in the body and so um

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,720
can we understand where this is actually

97
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,280
coming from and so we did an experiment

98
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,760
in rats where we um decreased the levels

99
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
of U3A using a different ASO than it's

100
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,680
being used in the clinic and we were

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
able to see changes within the tissue

102
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,599
and the brain tissue but that wasn't

103
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,280
reflected in the the CSF. And so we're

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,200
continuing to follow up on this as well

105
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,640
as trying to look at other biomarkers

106
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,199
with these samples that we have access

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,799
to to try to understand um and find

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,799
biomarkers that can be useful in

109
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,320
understanding how our therapy is working

110
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,240
and how um patients are are progressing.

111
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
And so with this, I'd like to just to

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
thank everyone who was involved in um

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,639
getting the us these CSF samples to be

114
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,240
able to do this work um as well as fast

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,520
and also our all of our academic

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
collaborators. Thank you.
