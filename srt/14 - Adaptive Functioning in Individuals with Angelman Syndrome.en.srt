1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,720
So now we're going to shift gears

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,240
totally um for the rest of the session

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,519
to human application and really talk a

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,240
bit about endpoints meaningfulness and

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,800
how we think about the assessments that

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,520
we're doing on our kids and how to best

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,760
understand them, support them and be

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
able to interpret them. So our next

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,519
speaker is Dr. Sarah Nelson Potter and

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,119
she's going to be speaking about

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,359
adaptive functioning in individuals with

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,279
Angelman Syndrome. And one thing I'm I I

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
would be remiss not to mention is that

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,960
you may have just received 250 emails

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
from fast and if you did that was um

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,920
likely because of the government

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,399
shutdown. So we can blame the government

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,920
shutdown for that. Um but no apparently

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,520
something happened with Cvent and a

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,480
bunch of emails warning you about the

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,800
flights went out to the entire listerve

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,320
and um ultimately there may be a lot of

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,760
emails coming your way. So you're going

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
to hear from us a lot in the next five

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,079
minutes and for that we apologize. Um,

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,079
so Sarah Potter, please come in for

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,079
that.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,080
>> Thanks, Alison, for the introduction.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,840
Um, I'm really super happy to be here

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,840
today to tell you about some of our

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
recent work in uh aimed at better

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,040
understanding adaptive functioning in

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
individuals living with Angelman

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,240
syndrome. And so adaptive behavior

35
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,479
refers to the everyday skills that we

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,320
all need to live independently. This

37
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,840
includes how we communicate with others,

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,720
how we take care of our own personal

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
needs. Things like eating, toileting,

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,240
hygiene,

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,560
um how we do chores around the house,

42
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,119
preparing food, managing our daily

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,040
routines at school, at work, at home,

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,840
and in the community, how we interact

45
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,840
with others socially, motor skills, and

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
so on. And we know that individuals

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
living with Angelman syndrome experience

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,040
significant deficits in adaptive

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,439
behavior that significantly affect

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,680
quality of life both for the affected

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,320
individual and for their caregivers as

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,679
you all know and this makes adaptive

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,720
behavior a key target for uh change in

54
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
therapeutic development in as

55
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,760
so many of you have participated in a

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
vin assessment before and the vin 3 is

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,080
the current edition of the vin and it's

58
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,520
considered is a gold standard caregiver

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
reported measure of adaptive

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
functioning. It measures adaptive

61
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,920
functioning in four domains.

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,319
Communication, daily living skills,

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,760
socialization, and motor skills. Today

64
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,519
we're going to talk a little bit about

65
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,319
both receptive and expressive

66
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,800
communication. Receptive receptive

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,879
communication being how an individual

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
understands language and expressive

69
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,599
communication involving how an

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,160
individual uses sounds, gestures, and

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
words. Um, we're going to talk about

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,800
daily living skills in the personal

73
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,360
subdomain. So that includes toileting,

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,120
hygiene, dressing, and eating. We'll

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
talk a little bit about interpersonal

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,840
relationships. So that's things like

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,959
early social behavior, imitation,

78
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,560
recognizing and expressing emotions, and

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,000
we're going to talk about both gross and

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
fine motor. So, we're going to talk

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,840
about gross motor being how an

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,400
individual uses their arms and legs for

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,480
movement and coordination and fine motor

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,519
being how an individual uses their hands

85
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,440
and fingers to manipulate objects. And

86
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,959
so, a few years ago, we had a study

87
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
looking at adaptive skills of

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,720
individuals with Angelman syndrome using

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,560
the Vinand 2, but some significant

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,640
improvements were made between these two

91
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
versions of the Violin. So the violin 3

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,200
has more items that measure early skills

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,360
which is really important for our

94
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,920
population. It has different scoring

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,720
criteria and most importantly it

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,879
accounts for AAC use in the expressive

97
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,680
communication subdomain. So you know how

98
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,920
important that is. So the aims of this

99
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,239
study are to describe how adaptive

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,159
functioning changes over time in

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,560
individuals with Angelmen syndrome and

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,120
to examine whether changes in adaptive

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,680
skills over time differ by molecular

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,720
subtype. All right. So we had 331

105
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
individuals in this study. Uh little

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,080
less than twothirds had a deletion

107
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,040
subtype and it was relatively evenly

108
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,359
split between males and females. age at

109
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,079
the first visit was um a little bit over

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,160
11 years on average. Um you can see it

111
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,120
ranged from six months to over 50 years

112
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,280
of age. Um which is really great. Um at

113
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,919
the last visit the average age was

114
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
around 12 and a half. Um and on average

115
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,280
participants had two visits but this

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,120
ranged from 1 to six. And so caregivers

117
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,840
completed the comprehensive interview

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,680
form of the violin 3 in the Angelman

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,919
syndrome natural history study in

120
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
Friious um in the brain development

121
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,040
study in uh Mark Shen's lab or at the

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,199
UNCC clinic and all of these data were

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,880
contributed to the latter database and

124
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,120
we access these data for this study. So

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,440
to address these aims we used mixed

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,639
effects models with restricted maximum

127
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,639
likelihood estimation. This isn't um all

128
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,320
that meaningful to many of you, but I'll

129
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,000
explain a little bit why this is. So, we

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,039
examine Vineland growth scale values,

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,960
which I'm going to talk a little bit

132
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,199
more about in a second, in relation to

133
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
the natural log of age and molecular

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
subtype. So, we use these models to

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,039
account for repeated assessments from

136
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,360
the same participants over time. And

137
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,080
this log transformation of age helped us

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
capture the faster gains that we saw

139
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,000
early on and the slower rate of change

140
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,160
that happens later, which you'll see in

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,240
just a second. So, a little bit more

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
about growth scale values. They provide

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,120
us with an absolute measure of adaptive

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,280
skill level and they're derived directly

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,919
from raw scores. They're not ageormed.

146
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,320
So, they allow us to track true within

147
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,880
individual change over time even when

148
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,479
standard scores are staying the same or

149
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,479
they're at the floor of the assessment.

150
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,880
And so, really, this just means that we

151
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,880
can observe more subtle changes in

152
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,520
development that's not often allowed

153
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,320
with some of our standardized tests. And

154
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,720
GSVs have equal interval scaling,

155
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,600
meaning that a one unitit change has the

156
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,759
same meaning across the entire scale.

157
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,080
And this makes them very well suited for

158
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,240
tracking growth over time within

159
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,800
individuals. So let's get to our

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
results. We are looking at these plots

161
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
now. We've got receptive communication

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,080
on the left and expressive communication

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,080
on the right. On our x axis, we've got

164
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,240
age in years ranging from zero to over

165
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,919
50. And then our GSVs are on the Y ais.

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
So our individuals with a deletion

167
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,639
subtype are represented here in blue.

168
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Those with a UB3A mutation in green and

169
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,919
those with UPD or an imprinting center

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,360
defect are in red. And so for both of

171
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,520
these subdomains, those with a non-deion

172
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,680
had a higher level of skills compared to

173
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,360
those with a deletion. In receptive

174
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680
communication, we saw that the rate of

175
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
growth in receptive skills did not

176
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,639
differ significantly between the subtype

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,560
groups. So you can see that their

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,280
trajectories are running parallel with

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,599
each other. However, in the expressive

180
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,240
uh subdomain, we saw that the rate of

181
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,080
growth was steeper in those with a

182
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,080
non-deion compared to those with a

183
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
deletion. So those with the non-deion

184
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,199
have a faster rate of growth early in

185
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,160
development. You can see it's a little

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,080
bit of a steeper trajectory.

187
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,080
In terms of personal daily living

188
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,120
skills, we see that again that those

189
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,960
with a non-deion have higher level

190
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,280
skills compared to those with a

191
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,759
deletion. And here the rate of growth is

192
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,440
actually steeper in the UB3A mutation

193
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,000
group compared to the deletion group. So

194
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,840
we see a faster rate of growth in those

195
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
early years relative to those with the

196
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,080
deletion.

197
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,319
In terms of interpersonal relationships,

198
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
we again see that uh that those with the

199
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,639
non-deion had a higher level of skills

200
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,960
compared to those with a deletion. Um

201
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,880
but we like we saw with the receptive

202
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,639
communication subdomain, the rate of

203
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,080
growth did not differ significantly

204
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,680
between the subtype groups. So again,

205
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,440
they're sort of running parallel with

206
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,960
each other.

207
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,440
And for both gross gross and fine motor

208
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,360
we see again that the non-deion groups

209
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,919
demonstrated a higher level of skills

210
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,080
compared to those with a deletion. And

211
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,360
again the rate of growth is not

212
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,599
significantly different between the

213
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:18,479
groups. They're running in parallel with

214
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:20,639
each other. So um we found that similar

215
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,960
to previous research individuals with

216
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,960
non-deion subtypes demonstrate a higher

217
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,199
level of skills compared to those with

218
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,960
deletion subtypes. There are some

219
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,360
differences between subtypes in the rate

220
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,919
of growth in various subdomains.

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,560
And we see these faster gains early in

222
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,039
development and slower change later on.

223
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,880
So the most rapid progress is happening

224
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
early in development and then gains

225
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,600
become slower over time, but they are

226
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,360
still happening. Individuals are still

227
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
gaining skills and they're demonstrating

228
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,399
growth in all adaptive domains. And this

229
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,480
really justifies a need for continued

230
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,800
services. So things like speech,

231
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,920
occupational and physical therapies as

232
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,920
well as academic academic modifications

233
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,320
which can provide opportunities for

234
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,800
sustained development.

235
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,880
And so we're next going to look at how

236
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,880
seizures affect the development of

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,040
adaptive skills and we're going to

238
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,680
examine whether other factors affect

239
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,600
adaptive skills and growth. And so I

240
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
just want to thank my colleagues at um

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,080
RTI and at Boston Children's Hospital

242
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,320
for helping to prepare this presentation

243
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
for today. Mark Shen at UNCC for

244
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,640
contributing data, the RO uh team at

245
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,399
Friezia for contributing data and our

246
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,560
Angelman syndrome natural history study

247
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,279
sites. Uh thanks most of all to all of

248
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,610
you families who participate in research

249
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:46,950
and thanks for your attention.

250
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,950
[Applause]

251
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
Thanks Sarah for that. And I think it's

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,600
important for families to understand

253
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
that that's information we've known for

254
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,040
a long time, but that's been based off

255
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,480
of the Vinand 2 and the Vinand 3. The

256
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,160
only reason that's important for you to

257
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,519
know the difference is because in the

258
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,440
current clinical trials where we're

259
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,519
trying to compare to the natural history

260
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
of the disease, we need to compare it to

261
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,320
the Violin 3. So having this now data

262
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,079
set is really important for sponsors as

263
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,680
they're looking at the use of island 3

264
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,360
in the clinical trials. One other thing

265
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
I just want to highlight for families

266
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,399
which I think is incredibly important

267
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,600
and often in these research

268
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,560
presentations um isn't really recognized

269
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
is the fact that we're dissecting out in

270
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,839
this enormous magnified way the

271
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
difference between deletion and

272
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,760
non-deion. And I guarantee you some of

273
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,320
you are even dissecting out the

274
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,320
difference between UPDICD and mutation

275
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,200
and wondering why the mutation line is

276
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,600
marginally above the UPD line. Um, but

277
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,519
you need to mag out a moment and realize

278
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,040
that they didn't show you actually how

279
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,519
that compares to neurotypically

280
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,440
developing peers that are age matched.

281
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
And if you were to mag out, the

282
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
difference between deletion and

283
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,440
non-deion becomes much much smaller. The

284
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
difference between UPD and ICD becomes

285
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
practically non-existent. And the

286
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,200
difference between Angelmen as a whole

287
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,440
and neurotypical is tremendous. And so I

288
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,040
think I have heard and as I I speak to

289
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,959
sponsors or people getting into the

290
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,800
field, I am often asked, well, it seems

291
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,279
like nonddion are not nearly as severe

292
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,839
as deletion. So maybe we need to focus

293
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,959
on the deletion. But what people need to

294
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,959
hear is that they're all really severe.

295
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
It's just that when you blow it out and

296
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,760
look at the details from a statistical

297
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,000
perspective, they're they're marginally

298
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,160
different. And so you can see those

299
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,200
differences. But what I really try to

300
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,680
explain to people is that regardless of

301
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,839
their genotype, they're non-verbal.

302
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,240
Regardless of their genotype, they will

303
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
not live an independent life. They will

304
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,360
have challenges with self-care and they

305
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,360
will will have challenges with fine

306
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
motor and gross motor skills. Yes,

307
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
they're different. but they're still

308
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
quite severe and I don't want to

309
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,480
underestimate that and the severity of

310
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,600
that and the implications that we all

311
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,279
want more regardless of the genotype.

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,279
So, it's important to just back it up

313
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
for a moment and put into perspective

314
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,480
for the industry partners in the room

315
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
that are thinking about how they're

316
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,240
going to design their trials because all

317
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
of these kids compared to neurotypically

318
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,920
developing peers are quite different in

319
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,399
a very similar way. So I just want to

320
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,399
make that very
