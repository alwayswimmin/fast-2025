1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
Um, but this next talk is really meant

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,840
to explain what is UB3A. We all say it.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,000
We've all learned to say it. Um, but do

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,799
we all understand actually what it does

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,840
and and why it's so important and why

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,160
ensuring we have UB3A

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,720
can help to improve the lives of those

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,519
living with Angelman Syndrome. So, um,

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,400
I'm excited for you to to hear Dr. Seth

10
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,480
Margolus from John Hopkins University. I

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
was lucky enough to hear him speak in at

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
fast Italy last year and when I heard

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,320
his presentation I was incredibly

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,200
touched by the intricacies of his

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:46,239
knowledge of UB3A and I've been working

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,000
now on UB3A for almost a decade and I

17
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,480
haven't heard someone so elegantly

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,399
explain what it does. So I thought it

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,640
was really important that I didn't only

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,960
hear that but you all heard that. So,

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,760
I've tasked him with explaining it in a

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,600
way that we all can understand because

23
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,760
it's complicated. It's super

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,199
complicated. Um, but I think he's going

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,960
to do that. I previewed his slides and

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,159
they're excellent. So, I have no doubt

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
that you're going to accomplish this.

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
And you could also explain that your

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,320
wife is a school teacher. So, you

30
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,840
promised me she was going to give a

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,760
thumbs up to your slides before you

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,720
actually gave them to our community. So,

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,220
Seth, thank you.

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,080
>> All right. Thank you, Seth. Thank you.

35
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,880
[applause]

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,920
All right.

37
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,479
Okay. All right. Um, thank you to the

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,400
Allison and to the organizers for the

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,600
invitation and thank you Allison for

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,040
that nice introduction. Um, as Allison

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,920
said, today I'm going to talk to you

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,159
about UB3A.

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,600
Um, and I think before I get into that,

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:49,680
I wanted to give some context.

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,840
So, our nervous systems, central and

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,759
peripheral nervous systems are made up

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,399
of neurons. we're all very familiar with

48
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
and they're really critical for our

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,759
behaviors, controlling our behaviors and

50
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
sensing our world. And within our

51
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,439
neurons, in all of our neurons and many

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,439
of you have already now seen from

53
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,560
several of the slides in previous talks,

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,720
these beautifully colored images,

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
these are proteins within all of our

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,400
neurons. These are proteins and

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,120
scientists have the capacity to color

58
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,879
these proteins. So, and I just name a

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,560
few up there and the specifics aren't

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,800
really important. What's really

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,239
important here is just to realize that

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,480
within our neurons are these proteins

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,080
and these proteins are what's doing the

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,879
functions of our neurons. So, the first

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,640
sort of take-home is neurons contain

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,200
proteins that do the work.

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,760
So, proteins aren't just there. They

68
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,560
don't just pop up from nowhere. Proteins

69
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,120
are made. proteins are made in all of

70
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,400
our cells. Okay? And I'm not going to go

71
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,680
through the details of these complex

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,680
molecular events that make our proteins.

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,560
But on the top part here where I write

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
nason protein, that's the birth of a

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
protein. And then there's the process

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,680
where it's folded. And eventually in the

77
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,760
folded protein, that's the protein that

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,159
goes on and does all the important

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,360
functions of all of our cells, including

80
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,879
neurons. And throughout this process,

81
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,200
our cells have this amazing capacity to

82
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,040
determine whether the protein's being

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,760
made properly or at a specific time

84
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,599
whether we no longer need that protein.

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,480
And that's this process where you see

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,360
the red being broken up into tiny little

87
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,560
lines. That's protein degradation. And

88
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,000
this process in whole is referred to as

89
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,360
protein homeostasis. All of our cells,

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,239
neurons included, want to make sure that

91
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
our protein levels, both the proteins

92
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,959
that are made and the proteins that are

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,120
degraded are kept at a even level. It's

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,760
very well regulated.

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,760
So the next take-home is proteins are

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,560
made and removed in our neurons. And

97
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,159
this removal process is controlled by

98
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,200
this incredible structure within all of

99
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,040
our cells, including neurons. This is

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,120
referred to as the proteosome. It's

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,759
something my lab studies in great

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
detail. And it might look complicated,

103
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,360
and I'm not going to get into all of the

104
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,840
details of what you're looking at here,

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,160
but I think you can appreciate that this

106
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,040
picture of this 20s proteosome on the

107
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,000
left looks kind of like a rectangular

108
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
barrel. And if we flip it and look down

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,919
the top, there's a hole there. And that

110
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,840
hole is where our proteins go to get

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,800
degraded.

112
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,240
So it's in some regard referred to as

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:53,280
the trash can of the cell.

114
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,759
So I'm going to go back. Okay. So the

115
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,240
protein complex here that's degrading

116
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,240
our proteins is really important for

117
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
cell function, including neuron

118
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,199
function. And all it does is degrade

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
proteins. So it needs help in

120
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,240
determining which protein should we

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,479
degrade. Otherwise it would just degrade

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,560
every protein that it came near. So

123
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,720
these larger structures, these gray

124
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,600
structures on the top, these are

125
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,600
referred to as caps. It looks like a

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,880
cap. It sits on the top and the bottom.

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,960
And these structures are very important

128
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
for unfolding our proteins. Remember you

129
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,840
saw that red folded protein. proteins

130
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,800
are in that folded shape. These

131
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,960
structures unfold the protein and put it

132
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:42,000
into that pore so it can get degraded.

133
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,080
So proteosomes remove our proteins.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Those are the key players. These are the

135
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,880
key critical players in this protein

136
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,520
homeostasis process and they're really

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,240
important for nervous system function.

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,120
So here's a neuron. It's flashing. It's

139
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,000
active. It's functioning. Okay. If I

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
inhibit the proteosome using a small

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,759
chemical inhibitor, you get a very small

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,360
change in in activity very rapidly. And

143
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,280
this is to illustrate here quantified

144
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,080
that a proteome

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,280
functions to control the neuron and if

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,160
we inhibit it, it very rapidly can

147
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,720
change the neuron's function.

148
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,280
Okay. So simply no proteomes you get no

149
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,600
protein removal and the neurons don't

150
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,720
function well. So the control the

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,840
proteosome's ability to control protein

152
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,759
degradation is critical. And I as as I

153
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,479
just mentioned

154
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,479
it doesn't just function all by itself.

155
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,440
It needs to be told what to degrade. We

156
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,960
don't just degrade every protein.

157
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,560
Just as you wouldn't just throw

158
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,560
everything in your house into the trash

159
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,039
can, it needs to be told what to

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,400
degrade. And that's largely controlled

161
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,120
by this process. This is the ubiquitin

162
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,520
proteome system. And many of you may

163
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,840
already be familiar with this. And

164
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,080
there's a series of steps that I just

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,199
want to quickly take you through. So

166
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,160
there is a substrate. A substrate is the

167
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,199
protein we want to degrade. And then

168
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,960
there are these other molecules E1, E2

169
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,199
and E3.

170
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,160
They work together

171
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,080
to associate with that substrate and put

172
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,440
that protein into the proteosome to

173
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,319
degrade it. And the E3,

174
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:39,520
that's what UB3A is. UB3A is the E3

175
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,199
ligase. It's one of 600 E3 liases in our

176
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,919
genome

177
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:50,000
that helps to target specific proteins

178
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,160
to go to the proteosome to get degraded.

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And so

180
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,800
what I want you to appreciate is that

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,160
UB3A in our cells in our neurons tags

182
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,360
some proteins, not all proteins, but

183
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,039
specific proteins to be removed by the

184
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,800
proteosome and that's good for the

185
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,599
neuron. That's the key appreciation for

186
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,160
understanding UB3A. And there's a lot of

187
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,160
mechanistic detail about how it does

188
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,240
that. We're not going to get into that

189
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,199
here, but I'm going to tell you more at

190
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,160
a high level about what are the types of

191
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:28,319
proteins that UB3A might target. How do

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,080
we go about finding that? And how may

193
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:37,120
that give us insight on how when UB3A is

194
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:40,479
gone, you get such a broad change in

195
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,399
developmental function.

196
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,159
So, a couple other details that I want

197
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,080
to point out.

198
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,640
Neuron is a complex cell type. You've

199
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,920
seen pictures of these before. You have

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,760
a soma, a nucleus, this sort of

201
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,480
triangular shape at the bottom, but then

202
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,839
you have these long processes and there

203
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,320
are proteins across the entire neuron

204
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,120
including inside the nucleus. And

205
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,399
proteosomes are located everywhere and

206
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,120
so is UV3A. And you can have ubiquitin

207
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,640
mediated proteosome dependent

208
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,760
degradation

209
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,760
at all of these locations.

210
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,480
And what's not always so obvious when

211
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,279
you look at these images is that the

212
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,680
substrates while the I should back up

213
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,000
while the proteosomes and the E3 liases

214
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,519
are everywhere the substrates in these

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
different location remember those are

216
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,120
the things that want to be degraded are

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,519
different throughout the cell.

218
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,480
I also wanted to make this point which

219
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:47,120
is UB3A is an E3 ligase is disrupted in

220
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,760
Angelman syndrome and there are other E3

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,200
liases that have also been found when

222
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,600
mutated lead to other

223
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,080
neurodedevelopmental disorders.

224
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,600
And so a big question in the field and

225
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,279
something my lab is particularly

226
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:04,560
interested in is to understand

227
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,800
what protein substrates of E3 liases are

228
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,680
relevant to human health. and in

229
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:14,000
particular Angelman syndrome. What are

230
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,600
the substrates of UB3A that give rise to

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,760
phenotypes that lead to

232
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,760
neurodedevelopmental dysfunction? And

233
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I'm going to tell you towards the end of

234
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,320
why I think that has some value in

235
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,040
thinking of leading to potential

236
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,760
treatments. So I'm going to sort of skip

237
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,600
over a lot of years of data and I'm

238
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,000
going to share with you at least one

239
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,160
substrate first and then I'm going to

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
tell you how we went to find every

241
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:41,760
substrate we could possibly find.

242
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,560
So as a postoc when I was working with

243
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,440
Michael Greenberg at Harvard we had

244
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,560
discovered this protein referred to as a

245
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,200
fexin 5 and this protein played a very

246
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,519
unique function in the nervous system.

247
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
So this these neurons are what we're

248
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,240
looking at here are fluorescent neurons.

249
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,920
These are expressing this GFP protein.

250
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,240
And we could quantify the number of

251
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,320
contacts these neurons were making with

252
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
other neurons. And what I hope you can

253
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
appreciate just from this bar graph is

254
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,040
that if you remove effects in five, you

255
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,519
get way more contacts. It seems like

256
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,160
it's a good thing, but it's actually not

257
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,079
the ideal situation.

258
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,760
So when we looked at this protein

259
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,480
effects and five labeled E5 on the top,

260
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,480
I hope you can appreciate and this is a

261
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,959
developmental

262
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,279
representation of looking at effects and

263
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,360
five at different stages in development

264
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,079
from neurons and you can see that

265
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,040
protein band at the very top going away.

266
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,440
That's this protein getting degraded.

267
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,959
So naturally this protein gets degraded

268
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,079
and that's something we learned as we

269
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:53,120
were doing research on this protein.

270
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,079
So, FEXin 5 blocks the neuron and it we

271
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:59,120
found was degraded by the proteosome and

272
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,040
it turns out with further research that

273
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,440
UB3A

274
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,160
was the E3 liase targeting this protein.

275
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,920
And what I'm showing you here is that

276
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,279
when I mix UB3A with effectin 5, you get

277
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,959
this smear, this band that sort of rides

278
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,519
up on the gel. And that's an indication

279
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,200
that this thing is being ubiquitated.

280
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,360
This is being targeted by effectin 5.

281
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
And in animal models where we remove

282
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
UB3A,

283
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,519
if you look in the middle lane of the

284
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,320
three lanes there, you can see there's

285
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,800
more effects in five. Okay, so this

286
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,920
predicted that UB3A targets effects in

287
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,399
five. That's what the data we're

288
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,920
demonstrating to the proteosome, which

289
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,200
we all learned about now. And so no U3A

290
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,120
is too much effect five. Okay, which

291
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,920
turns out to not be great for the

292
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,360
neuron. And the reason it's not great is

293
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,519
because when you have too much effects

294
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,959
in five, you actually have reduced

295
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,240
synaptic contact. And so we predicted

296
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,680
from a substrate sort of hypothesis that

297
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,600
if we reduced the effects in five in the

298
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,680
UB3A animal models, we would potentially

299
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,120
rescue behavior. And that's sort of what

300
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,959
we saw. So these behavioral tests sort

301
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,760
of evaluates

302
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,399
the sort of cognitive functioning of the

303
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,600
animal. And we learned on the left side

304
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,279
here that the animals have reduced

305
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,240
behavior compared to controls. That's

306
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,920
these lower error bars.

307
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
But that if we remove effects in five,

308
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
we could rescue that. And so reducing

309
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,200
effects in five restores function when

310
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,399
UB3 is gone. And in a more general

311
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:45,360
sense, it indicated the possibility that

312
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,920
substrates might be we know are

313
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,000
downstream of UB3A. That when UB3 is

314
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,560
gone, those substrates are now

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,320
deregulated. They're not being degraded

316
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,639
or they're not being regulated properly

317
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,440
and might be the foundation for some

318
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,320
aspects of phenotypes observed in

319
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,560
Angelman syndrome. So my lab became very

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,440
interested in like what are all the

321
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,440
substrates of UB3A? lot of technology

322
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,519
today allows us affords us the

323
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,560
opportunity to sort of go after

324
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,120
everything at once. So what this is sort

325
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,360
of de this image here is sort of showing

326
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,199
you is a sort of experimental outline of

327
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,040
what we did and I can take you through

328
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:30,399
it briefly. So we have basically glass

329
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,880
slides with 20,000 human proteins

330
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,920
printed on the slides. We can then

331
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,680
incubate remember the E1, E2 and in this

332
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,519
case UB3A and ubiquitin on these slides

333
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,560
and we could look at every protein that

334
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,880
could potentially be ubiquitated by

335
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,440
UB3A.

336
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,399
And on the right is a heat map. This

337
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,199
sort of demonstrates things proteins

338
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,199
that are more ubiquitated with UB3A

339
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,920
versus controls.

340
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,279
So what do we learn? UB3A has many

341
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,199
possible protein targets

342
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,399
and it's hard actually to look at the

343
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:10,399
data and you know easily separate out

344
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,839
which are the most important targets,

345
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,680
which are the ones that might have the

346
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,399
highest relevance. And so you have to

347
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,240
take your time to systematically

348
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,079
think about this and use

349
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,760
artificial intelligence or other types

350
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,160
of approaches to really begin to

351
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,519
understand what does all of this mean?

352
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,160
And I also want to keep something in

353
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:34,160
mind. Even though we see all of these

354
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:37,279
proteins that can be ubiquitated

355
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,120
by UB3A, it doesn't mean that they all

356
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:44,800
are being ubiquitated in our neurons

357
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:48,000
equally well or at least in a capacity

358
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,639
that mediates effects on our biology.

359
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,320
But it gives us a foundation.

360
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,959
So when we look at all these different

361
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,880
proteins and we try to understand what

362
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,040
are the different classes of proteins

363
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,040
we're seeing a couple things come out

364
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,360
that are interesting. Many of them are

365
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,600
expressed in the brain. Some of those

366
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,240
substrates are associated with other

367
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,079
neurodedevelopmental dysfunction. And

368
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,959
there are various pathways that might

369
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,639
indicate a relationship between the loss

370
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
of UB3A

371
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,160
and changes in some of the behaviors

372
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,720
that we've seen including motor deficits

373
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,399
and others that I think this group will

374
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,920
hear more about in the talks to coming

375
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,639
and are very familiar with.

376
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:35,519
So the sort of take-home here is some

377
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:38,480
UB3 targets are known a typo there to

378
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,160
impact various brain disease and be a

379
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,160
part of many brain processes. Okay. So

380
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,360
what do we do with this information?

381
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,759
Clearly adding back UB3A makes the most

382
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,560
sense. I think it's really the best way

383
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,360
to go because it's going to take care of

384
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,920
the loss of capacity of targeting these

385
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,880
different substrates. But if we were to

386
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,600
actually want to go after specific

387
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,360
substrates such as say effects in five,

388
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,600
how would we do that? Is that even

389
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,400
possible? That seems really hard. Well,

390
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,280
I'll tell you that technology today is

391
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,160
given us the opportunity to do that. And

392
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,240
some of that stems from the recognition

393
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,640
and the realization and alpha fold was

394
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,439
already introduced that we know the

395
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,079
structures or can generate the

396
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:30,799
structures of every one of these

397
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:34,320
substrates in association with UB3A.

398
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,919
So this is just an illustration where in

399
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,919
blue is the UB3A structure and in orange

400
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,880
is different substrates that we

401
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,960
identified. Now, why is this important?

402
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, it's important because it tells us

403
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,440
that UB3A binds its substrates

404
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,640
as do all liases. Okay? And that means

405
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,559
we can control that. We can control it

406
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,200
by using or identifying small molecules

407
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,720
that can bring together any two proteins

408
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,240
together. And these molecules are

409
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,840
referred to as molecular glues. So if

410
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:12,880
our goal was to take U was to say we

411
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,919
wanted to in the absence of UV3A target

412
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,960
one of the substrates, I could build a

413
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,200
molecular glue that could bring a liase

414
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,320
that is available that is still

415
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,360
expressed and target it to a substrate

416
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,520
that UB3A would normally target but now

417
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,360
can no longer because it's not there.

418
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,520
And I just wanted to introduce that

419
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,440
technology because I think it's relevant

420
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,840
for this audience.

421
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,200
So this comes from a collaboration with

422
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,919
a team of Hopkins scientists that I'm

423
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,360
introducing here where we've spent the

424
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,240
last four or five years maybe longer

425
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,280
trying to build some technology at

426
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,039
John's Hopkins to find these molecular

427
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,880
glue type molecules that would allow us

428
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,200
to bring together any E3 ligase with any

429
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,679
substrate of interest. And we do this in

430
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,760
such a way where we can look at as many

431
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
as possible.

432
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,720
Okay.

433
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,160
So drugging the human proteome.

434
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,720
So you're I've already introduced this

435
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,039
process to you to some extent where you

436
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,000
have a substrate, okay, and you have an

437
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
E2 and then you're bringing that

438
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
substrate all the way down to the point

439
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,360
where you're getting to the proteosome

440
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,039
where you can then get rid of that

441
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,080
substrate. And this little um I guess

442
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,440
it's a yellow drug, that's our molecular

443
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,760
glue. And our goal has been to identify

444
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,240
these molecular glues that bring

445
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,919
together an E3 ligase to a substrate of

446
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,320
interest to drive it to the proteosome.

447
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,960
So simply the way we do this is we can

448
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,520
express a large number of different

449
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,880
proteins. We can make any one of the

450
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,000
20,000 proteins in the human proteome.

451
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,240
There's actually more than that because

452
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
of isoforms, but we can make almost any

453
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,919
of them in any E3 liases. So in the

454
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,160
context of Angelman syndrome, we've been

455
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,640
making liases that we know are available

456
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:14,320
and still expressed and we've been

457
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,360
making substrates that we believe to be

458
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,200
relevant to the biology. We can then do

459
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,960
largecale screening and we can

460
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,240
ultimately identify these small

461
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,240
compounds that are effectively molecular

462
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,720
glues that allow for degradation. And

463
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,039
this is early days and this is a complex

464
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,280
process but we've had some success and

465
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,760
it gives us some opportunity to think

466
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,960
more deeply about the fact that there

467
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,360
are drug druggable capacities that allow

468
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
us to control normal cellular

469
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,000
degradation to remove target proteins

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,679
with a purpose and that would be an

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
ultimate goal and being able to test

472
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,480
that purpose is of great value moving

473
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
forward.

474
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,840
So I want to summarize getting us back

475
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,720
on time here. I want to summarize. So

476
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,280
neurons contain proteins that work. I

477
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,600
think that's very important to recognize

478
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:08,559
that they the proteins do the work in

479
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,360
our neur in our neurons. And proteins

480
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,799
are both made and they're removed. And

481
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,520
that's also really important to think

482
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,039
about. And proteosomes do this process

483
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,880
of removal. But you don't just remove

484
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:26,080
any protein, right? you have to

485
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,240
selectively choose that protein.

486
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,000
Okay. And another point I I sort of

487
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,000
skipped here, which is if you don't have

488
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,400
the ability to remove the protein, it's

489
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,880
not really ideal for the neuron. And the

490
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,000
way to specifically remove a protein in

491
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,640
the context of UB3A is to tag that

492
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,240
protein with ubiquitin, which then sends

493
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,200
it to the proteosome, and that's what

494
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,840
the neuron wants to have happen.

495
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,760
Now we've learned now that UB3A has many

496
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,440
many targets.

497
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:58,320
Okay. And those targets to some extent

498
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,840
give us insight into how the loss of

499
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,919
UB3A might give rise to a variety of

500
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,480
different pathways.

501
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:08,080
And reducing a UB3A substrate at least

502
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,960
in the one example I shared and there

503
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,760
are others in the field restores neuron

504
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,640
function when UV3A is gone. and that

505
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,919
there's now new technology that even

506
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,600
though UB3A may not be there, that would

507
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,159
allow us to still target those

508
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,640
substrates by co-opting another liase

509
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,640
and using a molecular glue to send that

510
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:36,320
substrate of interest to the proteosome.

511
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,400
And with that I will end a little early

512
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,120
but this none of this work is done

513
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,280
without the tremendous help from the

514
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,600
researchers that come through the lab as

515
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,655
well as the funding sources. So thank

516
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,675
you.

517
00:22:47,655 --> 00:22:49,675
[applause]

518
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,039
That was an excellent talk and I got

519
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,280
text messages throughout it just for the

520
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,600
record that said that that was the best

521
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,919
overview of UB3A function that they've

522
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,760
ever heard from scientists. So just so

523
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,159
you're aware that was amazing and

524
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,520
hopefully families could keep up with

525
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,400
understanding in summary that UB3A is

526
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,440
complicated and it has thousands of

527
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,360
targets of what proteins it's

528
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,840
controlling. Either it's tagging it to

529
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,200
be broken down or it's tagging it to be

530
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,600
maintained.

531
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,640
and trying to understand every

532
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,000
downstream target is really hard. Um,

533
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,440
and what I learned was that there are

534
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,080
600 E3 liases and UB3 is one of them.

535
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:45,120
And this is the result of that one out

536
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,720
of 600 liases. That's only E3, not E1

537
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,280
and E2, which shows the power of one

538
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,840
gene, which is pretty incredible.

539
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,320
Therefore, we need to replace that one

540
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,320
gene and then we can ultimately affect

541
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,799
all the targets. But you need to

542
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,120
understand the complication of this.

543
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,440
Which is why when we think about how we

544
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,360
approach and fund research, we have to

545
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,360
think about what is the impact that that

546
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,000
research could have on individuals

547
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,000
living with Angelmen.
