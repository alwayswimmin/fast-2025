1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,359
So, our last um speaker is uh Shady

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,720
Sedhon from Ro who's joining us

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,120
virtually. Unfortunately, he couldn't

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,800
make it in person and he's going to be

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,639
giving us an update on the phase one two

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,639
study looking at a logo and Angelman

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,639
syndrome.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,720
>> Can you hear me? Okay.

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,080
>> Yes.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,240
>> Perfect. Great. Thank you very much,

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,119
Alison. It's it's really unfortunate

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,160
that I was not able to to be with the

13
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,680
community this year. I used to to come

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,760
every year uh in the last five years. So

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,920
u I really miss you all. Um

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,239
um and thank you for inviting me to to

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:52,320
share updates about the uh Angelman uh

18
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:55,760
syndrome study um Alderbran uh study. Um

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,000
so as you all know that next slide

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,640
please.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,280
So this is me Shetty Sedum uh patient

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,280
partnership leader in um Enrush.

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,040
Next slide please.

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,040
Um and this is my disclaimer for today.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,200
Um, alabet is uh an investigational

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,479
therapy and the information which I'm

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,720
sharing with you today is for uh

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,520
scientific exchange and not for

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,159
permission purposes. And next slide

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,920
please.

31
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,400
So as you all know that lack of UB3A

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,000
expressed from chromosome 15Q causes

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,799
Angelman syndrome. And um shown here in

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,880
the uh right is a graphical

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,079
representation of the genes on

36
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,560
chromosome 15Q uh for typical inid

37
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,119
individuals in comparison to deletion

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
patient and mutation patients. You can

39
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,040
see from this that deletion angelman

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:04,240
syndrome has more than 10 additional

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:08,239
genes deleted in addition to the UB3

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,760
and that of course um has um an effect

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,560
and this uh presented in the natural

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,120
history study data um in Angelmen

45
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,400
syndrome and it is clear uh that

46
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,840
deletion angelman syndrome patients are

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:27,040
presented with uh more impaired clinical

48
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,120
uh phenotype. Uh if you look at the

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:35,760
bottom right uh the graph here uh we can

50
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,959
see this like more clearly from the bail

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,720
data uh measure measuring cognition. You

52
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
can see that deletion engine syndrome

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,879
patient has more severely impacted uh

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,400
cog cognition and in in addition to to

55
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,560
the this um to the clinical severity

56
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,680
observed in deletion angelman syndrome

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,000
patient they also present clinically

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,879
with a consistent decrease in the EEG

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,440
beta band power

60
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,879
and uh that's of of course in addition

61
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,159
to the delta

62
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,360
band increase seen in all Angelman

63
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,560
syndrome patients. Um and why is that?

64
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,560
If we look at the deleted genes, we see

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:27,599
that um it includes the GABA uh genes,

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,360
GABA B3, GABA A5, GABA A3 and the

67
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,480
product of these genes form what's

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:36,319
called GABA alpha 5 subunit receptor.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,000
And this receptor is very important. Um

70
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,120
it has been postulated that uh these

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,440
three deleted genes contribute to the

72
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,159
more severe clinical presentation in

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,920
deletion angel man syndrome patient and

74
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,879
that

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,120
restoring the GABA function could have a

76
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,560
therapeutic benefit for uh the deletion

77
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,159
angelman syndrome patients.

78
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:08,799
Next slide please.

79
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,799
Yeah, here you see on on the right um uh

80
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,519
schemically the product of the three

81
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,160
GABA gene I mentioned in the uh just

82
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,799
previous slide. They formed together

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,120
what is called the GABA alpha 5 receptor

84
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,320
and the GABA alpha 5 binds to a

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,000
neurotransmitter called GABA. GABA is

86
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
one of the most important

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,120
neurotransmitters or messengers in the

88
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,160
brain

89
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,600
and neurotransmitters like GABA can only

90
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,680
work when they bind to their specific

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,919
receptor. So there if there is any

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,360
dysfunction around the neurotransmitter

93
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,400
or its receptor uh that can cause

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,280
imbalance in the brain and with the

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,080
deleted GABA

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,919
uh we have less GABA alpha 5 receptor.

97
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:04,479
So this could be uh uh um of course

98
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,560
represented in the uh uh data uh and

99
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,440
differentiate between deletion engine

100
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,600
and uh mutation.

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,560
Um

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,960
here comes the alugabet the

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,080
investigation medicine which we are

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,759
investigating in the alderbrron study.

105
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,360
Alugabet

106
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,320
um is a GABA alpha 5 positive uh

107
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,840
electric modulator. It binds to the GABA

108
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,639
alpha 5 receptor and can it hence um can

109
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,600
enhance its function.

110
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,800
Um alabet is an oral therapy and it's uh

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,720
it's once daily and it was investigated

112
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,039
as once daily medicine and it has been

113
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
before investigated in enginemen

114
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:55,199
patients. It was um investigated in

115
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,160
healthy volunteers and also in phase two

116
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,919
clinical trial in adult and adolescence

117
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,840
uh with autism spectrum disorders. Um,

118
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,199
Alugabet um has shown acceptable uh

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,560
safety and tolerability profile uh to

120
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,520
date and currently as I just mentioned

121
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,360
is investigated in a study called Albron

122
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,680
for delician angelman uh syndrome uh

123
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,960
patients.

124
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,960
Uh next slide please.

125
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,199
So um at the branch study which is a

126
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,560
phase two study what we would like to

127
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,880
understand from this study first safety

128
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,280
and yes it was investigated before in

129
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,360
healthy volunteers and in um autism

130
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,360
spectrum patient but it is also

131
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:54,639
important to understand um its safety on

132
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,080
deletion angelman uh patients its safety

133
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:01,120
and tolerability permacinetics and this

134
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,960
This this means what does the body do to

135
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:09,039
to alugabet and what is the uh dose

136
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,639
required? Um as we just mentioned the

137
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,880
EEG beta band and the GABA. It is also

138
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,800
important to investigate

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,080
if

140
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,000
um alabet will enhance the gaba receptor

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,800
and will have impact on the uh EEG

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,520
specifically uh the beta band power and

143
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,880
we also um check some exploratory

144
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,720
clinical effects.

145
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,680
Next slide please.

146
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,080
So um albron which is an open label

147
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,560
study um open label means no placebo all

148
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,080
the patients receive u uh uh the

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,199
investigational therapy alapet is uh

150
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,720
tested in um uh children and

151
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,120
adolesccents.

152
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:03,759
So far

153
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,560
uh 48 uh male and female uh individuals

154
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,840
with um deletion engine patients were

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:15,840
recruited uh and the study

156
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:20,400
five to 17 years old. Um um it's

157
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,280
actually um currently in 20 sites in six

158
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:28,160
countries and I'm super happy and proud

159
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,680
to to say that this study is fully um

160
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,560
enrolled and I would like to use this

161
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,919
opportunity

162
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,320
um to express our deep appreciation to

163
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,880
the enginemen community

164
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,000
the the efforts the commitment to to

165
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,880
participate in in clinical trials. Um we

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,839
understand the significant dedication

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,959
and the personal investment the families

168
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,279
make and we are incredibly grateful uh

169
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,760
uh for the partnership with the uh

170
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,399
families with the patient organization

171
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,959
with F with ASF with ASA and all the

172
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:11,839
patient organizations across that loop.

173
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:15,040
We thank you really uh a lot. Uh next

174
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,320
slide please.

175
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,480
Um next

176
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:27,360
um next next until all appear.

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:31,040
So in conclusion, the alderrron study um

178
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,160
will enable us to explore uh the role of

179
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,560
the deletion GABA uh genes in deletion

180
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,279
angelmen syndrome and whether restoring

181
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,640
the GABA uh functioning with alugabet

182
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:47,440
could uh have a therapeutic benefit and

183
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:51,440
help uh angelman syndrome patients. Um

184
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,320
th this study is uh fully recruited and

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:59,200
we expect the trial to be completed by

186
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Q2 Q3 next year and we plan to share the

187
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:08,080
results as soon as uh um we get there.

188
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,080
So uh stay tuned. We will uh share the

189
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:16,640
results with you as soon as possible. Uh

190
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,079
next slide. Yeah. Thank you.

191
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
Thank you so much Shady and

192
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,120
unfortunately we don't have enough time

193
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,640
for questions but I do want to just

194
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
acknowledge the fact that that was a

195
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,399
hard study to enroll due to the fact

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,959
that a lot of patients with deletion

197
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,160
were also on benzoazipines for seizure

198
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
control and that was one of the

199
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,240
exclusion criterias at the forefront. So

200
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,920
that was a hard study to enroll and

201
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
congratulations to the community for

202
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,519
pushing through and getting it done. And

203
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,120
I'd also like to say that I think the

204
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,440
benefit of a drug like that could

205
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,279
actually be profoundly different in the

206
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
face of a gene replacement therapy or an

207
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,680
ASO in which you're replacing both the

208
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,440
GABA genes and UB3A. So, I I'm very

209
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
excited to see what combination therapy

210
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,519
might look like, and hopefully companies

211
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,519
are thinking about
