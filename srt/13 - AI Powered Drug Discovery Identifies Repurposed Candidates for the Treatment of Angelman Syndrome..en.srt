1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
So our next speaker is Dr. Wayne

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,240
Chadwick. He's coming to us from Helix

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,880
and he's going to talk to us about the

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,960
power of AI in drug discovery and how

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
they found some repurposed candidates in

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,639
order to think about how we can treat

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,639
Angelman syndrome. So here we go.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,279
Perfect. Thank you.

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,880
Right. Hi everyone. My disclaimer is I

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,719
work for Helix and at Helix we do drug

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
discovery a little bit differently. We

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,960
use artificial intelligence and machine

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
learning technology to predict which

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
drugs could potentially treat a rare

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,079
disease. And these are drugs which are

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,200
already on the market. They're approved

17
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,160
for different indications and we use our

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,039
algorithms to determine which of these

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,879
drugs we could reposition into a

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,320
particular rare disease such as Angelin

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,160
syndrome.

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,160
We've got about a 50% hit rate with the

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,479
drugs we predict for each of our

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,920
particular rare diseases we work on and

25
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,960
we've uncover typically between one to

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,640
five uh novel mechanisms for each of the

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,680
diseases including and syndrome.

28
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,640
We we are a clinical stage biotech

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,280
company. Um we focus on rare and

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,960
pediatric oncology as well as uh rare

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,159
neurology. And last time I spoke to you

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,079
uh I gave you an update on uh our lead

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
candidate for Angelman syndrome which is

34
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,079
0553.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
This is an existing drug again which was

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,000
approved for a separate indication which

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,280
we were hoping to reposition into

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
syndrome. It was really potent. It was

39
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
really impressive. It it it improved

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,119
multiple uh symptoms or phenotypes in

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,759
the mouse model.

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,759
The only problem was it was really

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,079
designed for short-term use and it

44
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,960
wasn't really designed for long-term

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,119
chronic use. But we were confident that

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,600
we could overcome that problem by

47
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,239
reformulating the drug. And that means

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,000
changing how the drug is absorbed by the

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,800
body and distributed throughout the

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,280
body. And we did this with our partners

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,680
TRX Bioscience who had a lot of

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,760
experience in reformulation.

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,959
However, it became quite evident early

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,400
on that the physical chemical properties

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,480
basically the structure of 0553 was

56
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,120
somewhat unique and it didn't allow to

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,920
be reformulated correctly. Basically, it

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,519
wasn't stable when we doed in the animal

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,319
and because of this we sort of had to

60
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,720
abandon it which was unfortunate but we

61
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,319
were really confident in the mechanism

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,120
which was driving or promoting or

63
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,120
improving the symptoms in an mouse. So

64
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,400
we thought we'll go back and look at

65
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,800
other drugs which have the same

66
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,599
mechanism to see if we could identify a

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,959
drug which was as effective as 0553

68
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,319
but maybe was able to be dosed over a

69
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,239
long period of time or would allow us to

70
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,200
reformulate it so that we could dose it

71
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,680
for a long period of time. But we needed

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,800
a way to compare these drugs with one

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,519
another and for that we needed to set up

74
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,840
an in vitro screen which we've heard

75
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,239
about today. So for this we used

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,239
angelman mouse neurons who have which

77
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,879
have a unique morphology. They have very

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,400
different uh type or or different

79
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,360
structure particularly with their

80
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,200
dendritic spines. Dendritic spines are

81
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,760
basically just the tiny little bumps on

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,599
the branches of neurons and they're very

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,920
important for neurons to communicate

84
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,480
with one another.

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
Now these angan mouse neurons like the

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,879
human neurons have fewer dendritic

87
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,799
spines and the dendritic spines that

88
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,920
they do have are mostly immature and

89
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,120
there's very few mature dendritic spines

90
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,599
and these factors means that the neurons

91
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,000
are just unable to communicate as

92
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,519
effectively as a healthy neuron would

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,519
be. And we knew that 0553 pro from the

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,680
previous work we had done was able to

95
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,560
not only increase the dendritic spine

96
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,640
numbers but also promote the matur

97
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,280
maturation of these dendritic spines so

98
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
that these neurons after treatment were

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,400
indistinguishable from healthy neurons

100
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,400
in terms of their morphology.

101
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,759
So we identified 18 drugs which had uh

102
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,240
the same or similar mechanism to 0553

103
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,360
and we tested them in this uh in this

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,880
assay and we identified 10 drugs which

105
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,040
were highly potent or as potent as 0553

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,880
and then we further sort of triaged

107
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,280
these drugs. We looked at their chronic

108
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,360
use potential, their distribution

109
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
profile, you know, if they got into the

110
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,360
brain at high enough concentrations and

111
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,000
their reformulation and commercial

112
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,919
potential. And we identified from this

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
we've got we landed on three drugs which

114
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,160
we wanted to investigate further. One

115
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
was an active metabolite of a drug which

116
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,240
is currently on the market. The other

117
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
one was a shelved asset and that means

118
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,120
that this particular drug had actually

119
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,000
reached a phase three clinical trial for

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,039
a separate indication but the company

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
which was progressing it decided to

122
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,880
abandon it for commercial reasons. But

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,440
it was safe and it was actually useful

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,800
and and can be used chronically so it

125
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,160
doesn't need to be reformulated. So

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,520
that's quite exciting for us because

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,560
that means this drug can transition into

128
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,720
and syndrome quite quickly.

129
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,479
The other is another drug which is on

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
the market already but it's only

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,280
available through prescription.

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
So this is a data of the dendritic

133
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,000
spines. So I won't go into it but

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,479
suffice to say that all three drugs

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,280
improved the number of dendritic spines

136
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,160
in the angel neurons and also promoted m

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,479
maturation of these dendritic spines. Uh

138
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,000
so that these neurons were basically

139
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,120
indistinguishable

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
in terms of their morphology from uh

141
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
healthy neurons and that means that

142
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,199
these neurons could effectively

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,600
communicate better. But next we wanted

144
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,160
to see how these drugs actually fared in

145
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,759
when we do it in an angelin mouse. So we

146
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,400
did this. We uh dosed the the drugs for

147
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,960
around two weeks prior to putting them

148
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,280
through a battery or behavior tests. We

149
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
looked at motor deficits. So we put them

150
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,759
in an open field and assessed their

151
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,080
mobility. We assessed how many marbles

152
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,960
they could bury. We also looked at their

153
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,000
grip strength, fallen grip strength. We

154
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,759
assessed motor control. And we looked at

155
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
their balance and coordination on a

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,000
rotor rod. So seeing how long an animal

157
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,400
can stay on an accelerating rod and this

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
apparatus also allows us to measure

159
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,639
motor learning. And then we also

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,520
measured their cognition

161
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,280
using the object recognition test. So

162
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,800
seeing how the animals are able to

163
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,560
differentiate between two objects.

164
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
So this is the data. So let me just

165
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,360
orientate you to these graphs. The white

166
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,120
bar are the healthy mice and that's what

167
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,400
we're trying to achieve with the drug

168
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,720
treatment. The gray bar is the angelman

169
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,039
untreated animals and kind of want to

170
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,280
move away from that that level as as

171
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,960
much as possible with treatment. So if

172
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,599
we just look at the distance moved in

173
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,639
the open field, we see that helix B and

174
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,280
Helix C treatment drugs increase the

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,199
mobility of the animals in almost

176
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,840
comparable to what we see in the healthy

177
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,880
animals. Surprisingly, Helix A was not

178
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,360
as effective, but all three drugs were

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,240
able to increase the ability of the

180
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,720
animals to bury marbles significantly

181
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,800
better than the the Angelin untreated

182
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:49,280
group. And again, Helix B and C

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,199
performed uh much better than Helix A.

184
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,120
Surprisingly, none of the drugs improved

185
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,120
the grip strength, but all three drugs

186
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
were able to improve the motor control

187
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,919
in the animals by looking at the

188
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,240
clasping. And again, Helix B and C were

189
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,039
much more superior improving the motor

190
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,680
control comparable levels that we see uh

191
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,199
with the healthy animals.

192
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,240
Now, this is really impressive to me.

193
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,879
This is the the rotor rod assay and in

194
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,120
this graph the dotted line represents

195
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,840
the angelman untreated group and then

196
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,960
the the gray bar on top or the gray line

197
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,000
on top indicates the healthy animals.

198
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,680
And if we just focus on day one, uh we

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
can see that all three drugs

200
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,919
significantly improved the balance and

201
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,320
coordination of the animals. So the

202
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
animals were able to stay on the this

203
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,039
accelerating rotor rod for a

204
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,200
significantly longer period of time. But

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,279
what's really impressive is again helix

206
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
BNC groups, their balance and

207
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,760
coordination is indistinguishable from

208
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,680
from the healthy animals. And then if we

209
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
look at each day of testing, so if we

210
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,560
test the these animals on the rotor rod

211
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
for days two to five, we see that the

212
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
balance and coordination of these

213
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,720
animals improves with each day of

214
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,279
testing for helix B and C. And this is

215
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,560
indicative of improved motor learning,

216
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,200
which again is really really impressive.

217
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,440
Uh helix A again was was less effective

218
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,680
at this.

219
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,839
And all three drugs were able to improve

220
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,080
cognition. So all three uh drug

221
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,360
treatments groups were able to to

222
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
distinguish between uh two objects. Um

223
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,160
so we've got an improvement in

224
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,760
recognition memory here.

225
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:32,640
So just to conclude um helix B and helix

226
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,880
C helix B being the shelved asex helix C

227
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,440
being the prescribed drug we're able to

228
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,399
restore motor control coordination and

229
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,720
memory in the mass back to levels that

230
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,320
we see with the healthy animals. And

231
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,480
this is really impressive. We've got two

232
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,279
drugs which could potentially move into

233
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,080
the clinic quite quickly here. Helix A

234
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,480
was less effective and he improved a

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,839
certain amount of phenotypes.

236
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,440
Um, and just to reiterate, Helix B is

237
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,120
suitable for chronic use. We don't have

238
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,480
to mess around with reformulation for

239
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,279
this. So again, they can move quite

240
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,920
quickly into the clinic. Helix A and C

241
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,519
does however require reformulation. But

242
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
the good news is we've already started

243
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,760
some of that reformulation work and the

244
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,720
reformulation is stable and we've

245
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,720
already seen improved amount of uh drug

246
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,959
in the brains of mice with the

247
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,240
reformulation and we're hoping that that

248
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,200
equates to improved e efficacy uh

249
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,079
particularly for helix A.

250
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,240
So just to say again that helix B and C

251
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,480
look look promising and we're hoping to

252
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
be some somewhere close to being in the

253
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,839
clinic by sometime next year. Um but it

254
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,120
all depends on uh licensing discussions

255
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,720
with the the holders of the um the shelf

256
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,720
asset. So thank you.

257
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,880
See, so I think if you didn't understand

258
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,720
in vitro and in vivo, you would not have

259
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,320
no clue what he just said. But because

260
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,399
you listened so carefully this morning

261
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,120
that was very clear that we have

262
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,399
potentially some downstream targets that

263
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,120
could affect because this is not

264
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
replacing UV3A but that could have an

265
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,399
impact on some of the symptoms of

266
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000
Angelman syndrome. So that's exciting

267
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,000
very promising and when it's a

268
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,279
repurposed drug it may have already been

269
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
through some of the safety assessments

270
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,959
that allow you to get from mouse to

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,200
human a bit faster. That's also very

272
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,200
exciting.
