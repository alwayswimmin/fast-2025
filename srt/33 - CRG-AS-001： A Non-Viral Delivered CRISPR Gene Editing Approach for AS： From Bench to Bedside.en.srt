1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
So our next presentation is a trio and

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,600
I'm very very proud to be part of that

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,200
trio. Um this is Yang Wei Jiang who does

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,759
not need an introduction and Jang Bing

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,440
Xu who actually also I think after four

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,759
years now or three years also doesn't

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,279
need an introduction. This is an amazing

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,960
team at Yale um who Jennifer and I have

9
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,119
been lucky enough to be able to work

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,519
with over the past couple of years as we

11
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,160
advance this program which is one of the

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,760
most exciting novel cutting edge

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,679
programs that I've been lucky enough to

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
be a part of. And what we want to share

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,920
with you all today is where we are.

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,399
We've been working on this diligently

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,000
and it's been really really complicated.

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
And as we're starting to see more and

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
more success and really moving the

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,160
needle on bringing us closer and closer

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,399
to a possible future clinical trial, we

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,079
wanted to share that data with you. Um,

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,399
so I'm here representing myself and

24
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,680
Jennifer. Um, but Young Way and Jung

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,760
Bing are going to talk to you about the

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,199
technology and what we know in the

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,960
animal model and then I'm going to share

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,879
with you how we've taken that from the

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,520
mouse model and what we're doing to try

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,520
to move that to humans. Yay. Chambi

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,520
you can start

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,439
>> thanks Alison for the introduction and

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,159
good morning everyone uh for those who

34
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,280
don't know me I'm a engineer on the team

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,479
so my responsibility is to uh without

36
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,320
disclosure so so my responsibility is

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:32,880
should I go through this slide up

38
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,560
>> I think you You want me to do it?

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880
>> He knows this slide, but I'm happy to do

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,720
it. So, really the goal of this project

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,960
and I think why this project got funded

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,880
and got incredible support from the NIH

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,040
is because we really created this

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,759
benchside to bedside model to go from

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,240
discovery and preclinical work at Yale

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,840
to clinical trials at Yale and Rush. And

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,439
we were able to kind of put all the

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,840
pieces together in this development

49
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,520
program all through the support of our

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
community who developed this entire

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,320
ecosystem of benchside to bedside. And

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,960
because of that ability to be able to

53
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
truly translate drugs to humans, the NIH

54
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,800
believed in us and got us to this

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
program um and and funded this program.

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,800
And so we've been able to really support

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,560
that over time. So we'll we'll start

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
with the pre-clinical program and then

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
we'll move to the the toxicology program

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,920
and then hopefully the future for

61
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,920
clinical trials. Now you can go.

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,840
>> Okay. So as I just mentioned uh I'm a

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,080
engineer on the team. So my

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
responsibility is to create a carrier to

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,239
deliver our superic payloads to right

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,120
location. So this case is the neuron

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,280
cells in the bra. So our payload is a

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
genome editor called crisper which

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,120
mentioned discussed by the last

70
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,040
presenter already. So uh crisper

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,519
actually originate originate from

72
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,560
bacteria is a hallmark of bacteria

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,800
defense system. So believe or not bacter

74
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,440
bacteria like a human beings could be

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,319
infected by virus. So you know through

76
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,159
evolution this bacteria you know derived

77
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,599
mechanism called crisus which can cut

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,720
the virus genome. So that that case they

79
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,560
can kill virus. So over a decade ago you

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,640
know I was scientists in the field

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,840
figure out a mechanism how to hijack the

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,200
mechanism for human use. So you know uh

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,800
so the magnet actually sorry

84
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,040
I show here uh has a you know two two

85
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,519
component system including cars is

86
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,239
basically the working machinery so like

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,280
in like a cus here for example cutting

88
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,440
the virus genome there's a ga so

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,239
basically the code to tell the machinery

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,400
to the right location

91
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,400
so but you know for principally the

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,879
major challenge is how to deliver you

93
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,200
know uh we as we discussed uh yesterday

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
and today in the gene delivery field

95
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,400
there's mainly two vectors available uh

96
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,959
one is a virus AAV uh we talk about AV a

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,280
lot this morning already so another is a

98
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
nanop particles

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,400
so you know uh so I will talk about how

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
you know we how I as an engineer you

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,959
know to to really uh uh solve this

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,280
delivery issue so this uh this slide so

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,040
basically shows that you know how of

104
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
scientists have been engineer crisper

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,079
for human use. So in addition to the

106
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,800
original formulation which can use for

107
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,759
genomic cutting to remove the you know

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,759
uh target gene. So this the machinery

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
has been engineered for other use for

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
example for gene correction or epigenome

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,320
editing. Basically we can repair

112
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,840
whatever defect you know in human genes

113
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,360
like EB3A we can correct mutations we

114
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,199
even can repair the the deletion.

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,600
So I mention delivery is a major issue

116
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,440
right? So there's the two uh major

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,320
delivery carriers in the field you know

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,040
including AEVs and which is most often

119
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,720
used at this moment and another is a

120
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,040
nanop particles. So unfortunately AV and

121
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,120
may not be the best vehicle for deliver

122
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
genomicus you know as mentioned right

123
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,479
this is a crisper derived from bacteria

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,120
and is active you know machinery which

125
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,600
can potentially cut your gum or or

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
modify your gum. So in this case you

127
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,919
know you can imagine if we deliver

128
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,080
crisper editors use a so this

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,160
editor will be expressed bacteria do and

130
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,479
the editor will be expressed in in human

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,360
cells for a long time probably over over

132
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,600
a decade. So you can imagine right could

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,960
mess up our genome in addition to the

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,199
imu reaction. So you know other than

135
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,639
virus nanop particles could be choice

136
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,960
you know particularly lipid nanop

137
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,400
particles but unfortunately lithium

138
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,080
nanop particles may not be best for for

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,639
neural use particularly this case you

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,280
know for ang syndrome because you know

141
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,840
it's very difficult to deliver or n

142
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,520
other nanop particles to the brain and

143
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,680
through introvenous administration

144
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,160
particle need to cross blood vessel and

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
get into the brain but the vessel in the

146
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,080
brain is very different from vessels in

147
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,840
other organs you You know they form a

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,840
mechanism called bloodb brain barrier

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,639
which have been mentioned by previous uh

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,080
speakers already. So most particles

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,680
could not cross the BBB valve but even

152
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,759
in the local administration or deliver

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,520
number puncture right just like iso

154
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
delivery you know the particles could

155
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,680
not be disposed in the brain well you

156
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,240
know could be simply because they're too

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,199
large most nanop particles probably over

158
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,680
60 you know couple hundred nanometer but

159
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,360
you know the the free space in the brain

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,120
tissue actually is very small probably

161
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,199
less than 30 nanometer so

162
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
To overcome this issue you know uh we

163
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,840
develop a new approach we call step

164
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,720
engineering approach. So you know uh so

165
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,960
step we present a group of chemicals is

166
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,600
a small chemical is about 2 kiloton very

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,919
small. So those chemicals are designed

168
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:57,120
to you know with two arms you know the

169
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,160
one arm you know intact with payloads in

170
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,479
this case genomatus. So another arm you

171
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,360
know is designed to intact with specific

172
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,520
cell type or organs. So you know in this

173
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,199
case you know uh for genomatic editors

174
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,360
we can just you know conjugate them

175
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,400
together and then the sum molecules you

176
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,639
know you can believe a lot you know work

177
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,319
you know work so well with integr

178
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,960
payload so well you know you only need

179
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,000
to put two 10 to 20 those small

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,199
chemicals you know with our pro uh

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,039
genomeic payload you know in this case

182
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,280
so this chemicals can bring this you

183
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,520
know super you know payloads into cells

184
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,280
and release Um

185
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,680
so the beauty of this approach is that

186
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,759
you know step engineered you know genome

187
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,520
edits you know the protein based editors

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,120
called RMP

189
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
you know are very small is about 10

190
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,520
nanometer you know is perfect for brain

191
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,680
penetration in terminal size so you know

192
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,400
compared to others right nanop particles

193
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,840
probably you know over 100 nanometer so

194
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,560
of course I would like to mention that

195
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,199
you know step is a concept so we

196
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,599
actually have synthesized a large label

197
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,879
st chemicals and different chemicals

198
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
They have different properties. You

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
know, for example, some chemicals like

200
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,199
neuron cells they kind of know after you

201
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,919
know injection they preventually add the

202
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,560
neuron cells. Some like eststerides and

203
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,560
some probably like other organs. But of

204
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,039
course for syndrome we you know our

205
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
target is the neuron cells in the brain.

206
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,680
So you know so in this case we choose a

207
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,400
specific step molecule which you know

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,319
can edit the neuron cells very well.

209
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,839
Just you know give example here. This is

210
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,080
a testing this you know step RMPS in

211
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,959
patient derived neuron is a 2D neuron

212
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
grow on flask flask basically what we

213
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,640
found is that you know single image

214
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,640
treatment can edit the most you know

215
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,560
over 90% of neuron cells in the dish so

216
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,360
the the also very high in 3D neurons so

217
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:58,959
organoid is a sphere culture you know in

218
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,880
3D fluid 3D form fluid so basically we

219
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,920
found that once single treatment really

220
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,320
addit most cells within silver

221
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,360
organoids. So you know efficiency could

222
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,519
be up to you know 90%. So and over the

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,959
past few years we have been you know

224
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,480
synthesize you know steps and then work

225
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,600
together with John's lab to characterize

226
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,600
you know submp forment treatment in

227
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,600
preclinical studies. So okay.

228
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:39,360
So um when I relocated from Duke to Yale

229
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:42,480
end of 2019 then I met Jen Bing roughly

230
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,480
middle of the co 2021. So we kind of

231
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,279
learn he has this technology. So my lab

232
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,320
work a pan of a disease. So say okay

233
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,480
maybe this is a great potential to to

234
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,640
pick a disease genetic disease and to

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,440
develop a treatment. I mean as you

236
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,160
probably know uh the first choice is and

237
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,959
syndrome that's my favorite dear to my

238
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,920
heart. So I I don't think I need to go

239
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,680
on to this slide too much detail. So the

240
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,880
idea is this step technology same as

241
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,959
anti-sense oliggo you can inactivate

242
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,600
anti-sense. The difference from

243
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,720
anti-sense algo is you need to repeat

244
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,640
multiple times keep going for step

245
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,880
technology is a crisp editing if work by

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,320
design it's only one time permanent

247
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:38,959
inactivated anti- sense that's it so

248
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:42,560
that's the building um so just shows you

249
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,640
the concept has been showed by ASL

250
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:52,000
ATF and top summer small molecu

251
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:55,120
and cast 9 in use a V vector um and also

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,880
cast RNA in activation. So it's

253
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,279
basically again this is you are very

254
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
familiar with and the paternal com

255
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,720
anti-sense is very long if you can

256
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,880
inactivate it transient or permanently

257
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,440
then you can reactivate a gene for

258
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,600
maternal chromosome we use a delion as a

259
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,680
case but presumably this technology

260
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,079
should be applied to all other different

261
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:21,040
genotype

262
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,519
um so this is a slide um when shaalu was

263
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,480
a post at that time now she's a research

264
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
scientist

265
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,560
shows me particular on the

266
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,680
right side of that particular western

267
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,560
blood. It's a protein analysis. When she

268
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,760
showed me this blood, I immediately got

269
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,880
quite excited and convinced. I told her

270
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,480
I said we got a program. This is a

271
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,560
walking working beautifully. So just

272
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,920
shows you that you can see there's no

273
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:55,120
treatment red is no very minimum protein

274
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,680
with three sample um treated and from

275
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,480
the mouse brain it shows a beautiful

276
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,720
reactivation very clean.

277
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,839
So on and the same thing we validated we

278
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,480
have she has done like almost more than

279
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,959
20 cohort several hundred miles

280
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
validated all the funding pretty

281
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,120
efficiently

282
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,959
and one of the beauty for the step

283
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,160
versus the other deliver technology AV

284
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,120
we deliver the cast 9 protein as Jamian

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,120
alluded to this protein goes into the

286
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,240
invivo in we do the intraigal injection

287
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,839
which shows you Here that green signal

288
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,399
you can see after day one injection 1

289
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,959
hour, 3 hour, 6 hour, 12 hour by 12 hour

290
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,000
but 24 hours is almost you cannot detect

291
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,079
any cast protein as you probably all

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,800
quite familiar with when talk about

293
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,440
crisp editing. We want to fix the

294
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,760
genetic mistake here is inactivated. You

295
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,480
also want to make sure

296
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,120
this editing not go to the other part of

297
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,839
the genome create another genetic

298
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,800
condition. But with this technology so

299
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,320
short transient press for in the in the

300
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,440
cell. So to definitely minimize the

301
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,920
potential off event which is one of the

302
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,320
major concern for crisping that's a lot

303
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,079
of advantage for crisping the major

304
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:26,720
concern is the safety. So with this and

305
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:29,600
then we also um demonstrate um using the

306
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,000
animal model um we generated many many

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
years ago when I was at Dr. dash lab and

308
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,040
there many people use this line too. uh

309
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,639
just shows you this is a very busy slide

310
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,680
a lot of work to get a few key point one

311
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,920
is we deliver the crisp editing at day

312
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,839
one of the mice after birth day 21 day

313
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,399
42 in this particular loan motor assay

314
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:58,959
it's almost very very similar regardless

315
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,839
day one day 21 and day 42 so that's the

316
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,560
one point key point second key point

317
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,480
which shows multiple cast 9 all working

318
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,600
well for step technology which shows you

319
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:14,079
the step may be able to adapt to many

320
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,519
different type of the cash now other

321
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,240
editor. Uh this Allison shows you this

322
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,600
slide yesterday and we just quickly

323
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,279
shows you um with the content which

324
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,680
clearly see this as treat with crisper

325
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,480
doing much much better all similar to

326
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,399
the white type.

327
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,800
We have shear have done a battery of lot

328
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
of behavior testing because the time I

329
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,920
just shows you a few key one. The second

330
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,480
one we just show you is this sie

331
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,279
susceptibility. Clearly with this

332
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:53,040
paradigm developed by B a field part of

333
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,600
UNC you can see the again different day

334
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,600
day one or day 21 treatment they

335
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,480
significant suppress the seizure

336
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,279
threshold inj

337
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,760
mouse model. So with that I'm going to

338
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,760
turn to Allison.

339
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,000
>> Great. So what you can see is, you know,

340
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,680
he he called me and said, "You're never

341
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,240
going to believe this. There's this guy

342
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,800
at Yale, his name is Jang Bang Zoo, and

343
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,160
he has this amazing technology, and I

344
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,279
think it works for Angelmen syndrome."

345
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,720
And I thought he was going to show me a

346
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,959
couple cell lines, and we were going to

347
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,959
get excited and fund grant to see if it

348
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,120
worked. But instead, he showed me all of

349
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,440
this animal data that Shauna had been

350
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,920
doing. And what he showed was not only

351
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,440
that it rescued every phenotype, but it

352
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:42,480
rescued it at newborn, at juvenile, and

353
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,560
at adult ages. And in some assays,

354
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,639
adults did better than the newborns. So

355
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,279
I was like, we have to support this.

356
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,600
This is incredible. And so this is where

357
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,360
we decided we're going to create a team,

358
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,680
work together, and figure out a way to

359
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,040
get this to humans because, as you know,

360
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
really the only thing I care about is

361
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,600
getting out of a mouse and getting into

362
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,560
a human. And that's where my my strength

363
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,560
is is what can we do to move this out of

364
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,680
an academic lab and actually get it into

365
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,839
a clinical center. And so Jennifer I

366
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,680
recruited into this and said we have to

367
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,519
do this. And she fully agreed and was

368
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,880
blown away. And she's been she's not

369
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,800
standing here, she's sitting there. But

370
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,399
she's been a force with this program.

371
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,959
And I'm going to explain why because

372
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,800
it's actually really really complicated.

373
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,480
It's beautifully elegant but also

374
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,880
incredibly complicated. And she's been

375
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,560
an unbelievable force on how we do that.

376
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,880
So when we think about the translation,

377
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,920
that next step to get from the Angelman

378
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,759
mouse to an Angelman human, there's a

379
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
lot of steps that we take and I'm not

380
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,759
going to walk you through every bit of

381
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,880
it, but it's the the safety assessments

382
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,440
to understand is does it go where we

383
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,440
want it to go and is it safe. So the

384
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,000
steps it takes to get through that is

385
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,839
called um you know the investigational

386
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,639
approach to getting to a first in human

387
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,399
clinical trial are IND enabling studies.

388
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,240
It's those studies required by the

389
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,560
regulatory authorities and for us to

390
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,039
feel comfortable that it's doing what we

391
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,959
want it to do. And so those experiments

392
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,079
are really assessing very critical

393
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,919
information related to safety, related

394
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:16,079
to toxicity, understanding if it's, you

395
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,480
know, having any ill effects, but also

396
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,880
is it targeting the goal? Is it

397
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,559
targeting the anti-sense transcript? Is

398
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
it knocking down the anti-sense

399
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,839
transcript? and is it expressing the

400
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,799
paternal UB3A gene ultimately making the

401
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,640
paternal UB3A protein and is it

402
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,240
affecting anything outside of that?

403
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Right, that's the target. But what about

404
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,320
offtarget? As Yangi mentioned, we don't

405
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,880
want it to affect anything else other

406
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,320
than the UV3 anti-sense transcript that

407
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
could result in a different genetic

408
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,360
disorder. Um, we're dealing with enough.

409
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,679
We don't need a second genetic disorder.

410
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,679
And so it's these studies are really

411
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,679
critical in order to get there. And

412
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
again, those are called IND enabling

413
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,480
studies. And a lot of you like, well,

414
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,080
what's taking so long? We've now heard

415
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,080
about this for two years, and why aren't

416
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,919
you in humans yet? Well, these studies

417
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,240
are really complicated. They take a very

418
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,919
long time, and they're very expensive.

419
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,000
So, we really take all these rigorous

420
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,600
activities. We work in parallel. We

421
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,919
really bring in experts in the field to

422
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,039
help us support us in getting this done.

423
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,799
And um you know some of the most

424
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,120
expensive aspects and the most time

425
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,679
consuming parts of this program lie in

426
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,240
this period where we have to understand

427
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,799
the ph what we call the phicodnamics. So

428
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,679
these are big words but ultimately it's

429
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,440
does the step R&P knock it down and

430
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,440
express the UB3 protein where does it go

431
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,280
in the brain? Is it only in the brain

432
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,360
stem? Is it only in the spinal cord? Is

433
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,440
it in the cortex, the hippocampus? the

434
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,520
parts of the brain that we know control

435
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,120
the behaviors of people living with

436
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,799
Angelmen syndrome. And so we want to

437
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
make sure it gets throughout the brain

438
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,640
into the critical brain areas that we

439
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,360
believe are going to improve the

440
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,200
symptoms of Angelmen syndrome. How are

441
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,760
we going to deliver it? So that's called

442
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,679
the route of administration. So ROA,

443
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,160
route of administration. If we deliver

444
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,320
it into the spinal cord, can we go from

445
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,559
below at the lumbar spine like ASOS are

446
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,080
delivered as Jim showed you? Is this

447
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,000
behave like an AAV or like an ASO? If we

448
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,840
go from below, can it get to the brain?

449
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,600
If we go from the the base of the skull,

450
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,400
does it get to the brain? Do we need to

451
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,880
go with a little baby um catheter, a

452
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,440
little surgery into the ventricle of the

453
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,799
CSF compartment? And is that going to

454
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
give us the best distribution to the

455
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,799
brain? These are critical critical

456
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,039
questions because if it's a single

457
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,200
treatment therapy, we need to get the

458
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,280
best biodistribution in the safest

459
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,039
possible way and we need to be able to

460
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,039
prove that because this is an untested

461
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,120
therapeutic modality. We have a lot of

462
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,720
data on AV gene therapy and how it gets

463
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,200
to the brain and where it goes in the

464
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,559
brain. We have a lot of data on ASOS and

465
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,480
how it gets to the brain and where it

466
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,320
goes in the brain, but we have no data

467
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,400
on this very new crisper technology

468
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,760
because it's not being carried by an ASO

469
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,720
or by an AAV or by a lenti it's being

470
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,080
carried by this novel step component and

471
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,440
so we have to really answer those

472
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,520
questions and then is it safe

473
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,600
where at what dose level that we're

474
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,440
testing this a low dose a mid dose a

475
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,080
high dose? How does that translate from

476
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,400
mouse to monkey? How does that translate

477
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,360
from monkey to human? And we have to

478
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,320
understand is it safe at the doses that

479
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,280
give us the best brain distribution and

480
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,679
that allow for the best UB3A paternal

481
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,679
gene expression. And so these are very

482
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,320
very critical questions that we had to

483
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,960
ask. And so really what I want to show

484
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,679
you is what you probably are going to

485
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
register and remember is that we had to

486
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,000
then put it in monkeys, right? And so

487
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,159
this is really important because a mouse

488
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,679
is not a monkey and a monkey is not a

489
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,000
human, but a monkey is closer to a

490
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,760
human. And so we want to know what is

491
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,240
the best way to get it there. Is it

492
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,039
safe? And how do we get to the largest

493
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:56,080
portion of the brain? So we looked at a

494
00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:00,320
comparative study of monkeys using it

495
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,919
lower spine like an ASO, ICM, back of

496
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,240
the skull like an AV gene therapy or ICV

497
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,640
into the ventricle through a small

498
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,559
little um catheter that goes into the

499
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,000
ventricle in the brain. And if you look

500
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,720
at this at a half an hour on the left of

501
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,760
each one, at 24 hours in the middle, and

502
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,960
at 72 hours on the right, what you can

503
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,159
see is pretty obvious. You can see you

504
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,000
get much more of the compound to the

505
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:34,080
brain with ICV delivery than you do with

506
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,320
it or ICM. And so we really can see this

507
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,360
bio what we call biodistribution to the

508
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,919
brain and the route of administration is

509
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,400
going to be best if we can deliver it

510
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,760
that way. And doing that because it's

511
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,720
hopefully just a single treatment

512
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,880
therapy is not a hard thing to do. If we

513
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,960
had to do that multiple times with like

514
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,400
an ASO that would be very very

515
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,559
complicated because it is a small

516
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,919
surgery. It's neurosurgery to put a

517
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,240
small catheter right through the skull

518
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,080
and into that compartment. Um but a

519
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,679
single treatment therapy that's possible

520
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,360
and many gene therapies are actually

521
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,520
using that approach because it's

522
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,120
actually a little bit easier. A lot of

523
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,880
neurosurgeons know how to do that to

524
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,320
train people to do that. Even though the

525
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,520
ICM is a little bit less invasive, ICV

526
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,200
is possible because a lot of

527
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,760
neurosurgeons know how to do it. But it

528
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,080
is surgery. And so we needed to answer

529
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,159
that question. And these experiments

530
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,799
really allowed us to be able to do that

531
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,840
and to be able to show that very nice

532
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,720
distribution in these monkeys over time.

533
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,120
And so that has taken almost two years

534
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,000
to get to this point. And what we can

535
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,559
see is that it's tolerated these doses

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,080
the monkeys are surviving. And we are

537
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,880
able to see that it goes throughout the

538
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,679
brain by 72 hours. We really see you

539
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,600
know even at 24 and a half an hour we're

540
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,720
seeing a ton of it in the brain. And so

541
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,039
when we put that into a graph, what you

542
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,400
can see is that the entire brain has the

543
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,440
best distribution of the radioisotope

544
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,720
that's being captured by PET CT with the

545
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,080
ICV delivery. And that is the first step

546
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,559
to now the next stages of the program.

547
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,080
With that, there's the manufacturing of

548
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,480
this product. And I need to have a shout

549
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,000
out to Jennifer and Conrad and Derek. I

550
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,080
am only presenting this in the s most

551
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
most simplistic way because I remove

552
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
myself from all manufacturing

553
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,520
conversations because I find them

554
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,880
maddening and frustrating and they're

555
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,120
too complicated for me to actually

556
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
understand. So I'm being an imposttor at

557
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,720
the moment. But ultimately for

558
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,360
manufacturing it's really complicated.

559
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,679
We have to make the final drug using

560
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,840
what we call the drug product in a way

561
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,320
that not only is safe in animals but has

562
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,799
to be the cleanest possible way,

563
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,200
cleanest possible substance for people.

564
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,120
And that's very very complicated. Um

565
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,760
it's expensive, it's complicated, and it

566
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,720
takes a long time. And for this program,

567
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,880
we have a guide, we have a cast protein,

568
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,880
and we have a step molecule. That means

569
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,919
three different manufacturing processes

570
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,600
need to happen. And the quality of that,

571
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
and the team that's working on that has

572
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,080
been unbelievably incredible in order to

573
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,039
get that to what we call a good

574
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,799
manufacturing process for people. And so

575
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,640
that takes a lot of time and a lot of

576
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,880
money as well because of those

577
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
complicated three components and there's

578
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,360
not a track record like ASOS or gene

579
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,080
therapy on how you manufacture this and

580
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,880
complex it together. So if you put all

581
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,480
of that together which hopefully you may

582
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,400
think is very very complicated but I've

583
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,720
tried to simplify it in a way in which

584
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,640
you can see all of these pieces. You

585
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,720
start here and you go you go you go you

586
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,760
go. This is a drug development program.

587
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,600
It's very very complicated. In order to

588
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,400
get to the goal, which is the only thing

589
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,200
I actually care about, which is getting

590
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,120
to first in human, we have to be able to

591
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,559
show that it works as well in a human as

592
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,039
it does in a mouse because the mouse

593
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,120
only tells us so much. But it takes a

594
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,279
ton of work for the safety piece, for

595
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,679
the manufacturing piece, for the

596
00:24:55,279 --> 00:25:00,080
understanding of age and distribution

597
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,000
piece. And all of that together is what

598
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,320
drives drug development. And this is a

599
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,919
program that is being driven by so many

600
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,600
incredible people that are all

601
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,120
contributing to all of these pieces. And

602
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,919
I I'm just representing this in one

603
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,679
simple picture. And so you know

604
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,520
ultimately these studies that need to

605
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,520
bring human candidate to human

606
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,840
application take a tremendous amount of

607
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,159
coordination a tremendous amount of time

608
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,720
and money very careful coordination

609
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,880
between the real critical teams

610
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,200
preclinical nonclinical manufacturing

611
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,039
regulatory clinical all of this takes a

612
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
tremendous amount of collaboration and

613
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,960
every step of this you in drug

614
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,200
development in general there's

615
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,799
unexpected findings sometimes you're

616
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
like well the dose that worked in mouse

617
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,400
didn't work in monkey. Well, the dose

618
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,240
that worked in mouse worked too well in

619
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
monkey. We have to lower the dose. So,

620
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,000
you have to do all of these studies to

621
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,840
make sure you're really stepping up in a

622
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,320
way that is going to provide the most

623
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,240
information to ensure the rigor and

624
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,080
safety for humans is of utmost

625
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,000
importance and that can take time. So um

626
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,240
ultimately with all of the work that was

627
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,480
done here, we were able to leverage a

628
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,600
grant from the NIH in order to allow us

629
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,159
to leap from mouse to human and that is

630
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,720
the drug development ecosystem and

631
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,559
ultimately as we have done this

632
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,640
discovery and preclinical work and we're

633
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,520
moving toward the acceleration of this

634
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,679
clinical work um it's very exciting to

635
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,440
see this program moving forward you know

636
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,960
day after day and month after month and

637
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,039
it's super exciting to share that with

638
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,720
you. Um, so in conclusion, the program

639
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,159
shows incredible support through

640
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
infrastructure and collaboration,

641
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,400
bringing many teams together with

642
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,039
various expertise to allow for

643
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,799
efficiencies that can't really can't be

644
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,400
achieved in any other way. If you don't

645
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,799
get out of your silo, you get in your

646
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,960
own way. And so, everyone on this team

647
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,960
has gotten out of their silo, leveraged

648
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,880
the expertise of others, and allowed

649
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,360
them to work together to really advance

650
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:54,320
this program. And the fact that Angelman

651
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,039
syndrome is serving as an example for so

652
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,360
many other rare neurogenetic disorders

653
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,919
has allowed us to create this platform

654
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,919
for future personalized medicine. Not

655
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,840
only for Angelmen syndrome, not only for

656
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,279
single mutations that might benefit from

657
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:09,120
one different type of therapy or

658
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,640
another, but utilizing this platform,

659
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,279
but for other neurodedevelopmental

660
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,360
disorders as well. And so it's wonderful

661
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,520
and it feels great for Angelmen to be

662
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,880
that platform to help so many other

663
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,799
disorders. Um and as you know at fast we

664
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,320
work really hard to ensure that we want

665
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,960
to be the lowhanging fruit. We want to

666
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,480
be the example but we must ensure that

667
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,320
the example we show helps others that we

668
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,559
cannot advance the field if we don't do

669
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,799
that. So we are really leveraging our

670
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,720
pre-clinical and our IND enabling work

671
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,400
and our our clinical capacities

672
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,120
throughout this network to be able to

673
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,960
help many other diseases. Um so

674
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,440
seriously we we could not do this

675
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
without the support of the NIH. Um, we

676
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,039
got an over $40 million grant to support

677
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,760
this work. All of this work started in a

678
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,600
lab at Yale. So to these guys, I'm only

679
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,200
presenting the part that matters to me,

680
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,799
which is getting to humans. But we

681
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,640
couldn't do it without the unbelievable

682
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,000
technology that they've developed and

683
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,240
the commitment to the science that they

684
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
have had been incredible. And we can't

685
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,000
wait to bring Rush into the fold because

686
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,320
the clinical trial will of course be

687
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,960
supported by Yang at Yale and by Liz at

688
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,880
Rush. So hopefully the next steps is

689
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,399
when we can get to that clinical that

690
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,200
clinical piece which we're just not

691
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,960
quite there yet. Um so a thousand people

692
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,559
to thank. I'm not going to thank the

693
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
Yale team. They should thank the Yale

694
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:29,200
team. But what I can say is that the

695
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,679
collaboration of all of these people has

696
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,320
been so unbelievably incredible. There

697
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,320
is such a commitment to this program by

698
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,240
the team at Yale and courage and

699
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,320
courageous and fast and AS2 bio. Um,

700
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,320
Jennifer is just been a force to be

701
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,880
reckoned with and really been leveraging

702
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:50,000
the regulatory expertise to get

703
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,679
something so new and so unique um, over

704
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,919
the finish line and really bring that to

705
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,240
humans in a way that's safe, that's

706
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,640
going to be agreeable and applicable for

707
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,200
human application. And so it's been a

708
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,440
real um, a real honor to work with this

709
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,559
team and and I'm proud to represent them

710
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,240
up here. So with that, thank you to all

711
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,000
of these people that have been such a

712
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,000
huge effort in this program.
