1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,279
So now our next speaker is uh Dr. Shauna

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,160
Louu and many of you know her as a

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,000
little spitfire who um I always used to

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,679
say that I think that you know Yang we

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,080
might be the the smartest person that I

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,400
know and then I met Shauna and realized

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,520
that she might be smarter than him. Um

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,720
but she also speaks very fast and so if

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,080
you don't understand what she's saying

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
you raise your hand because I'm going to

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,400
make her slow down because she has so

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
much to say and she's so stinking smart

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,080
that she doesn't understand that no one

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,120
else can keep up with her. So there's a

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,840
lot to say, but she only has actually um

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
15 minutes, I think, uh in order to be

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
able to get through everything she wants

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
to. So slow and steady so everyone can

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,280
understand the amazing work that you are

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,039
doing. And she we asked her and tasked

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,920
her to create one last model, the last

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,399
one to ever be created, please, for the

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,480
large deletion genotype of Angelmen

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,480
syndrome, including all of those other

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,000
genes that we talked about outside of

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
UB3A.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
and through incredible effort and trial

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,040
and tribulation, she has been

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,880
successful. So, I'm so excited to share

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,360
this with you because I hate models, but

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,040
this one I think is a true testament to

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,040
her dedication. So, Shauna, please.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,520
Okay. Um, thanks for this opportunity.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,840
Today I'd like to share an update of our

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,880
study um, the new large deletion MOS

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,479
model for and syndrome.

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,520
The commonly used UB3A XM2 deletion

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,439
model only represent about 10% of

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,320
androma syndrome patients with

40
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,240
intrangenic mutation. Since most people

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,920
with androma syndrome carry a large

42
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,479
leion in the chromosome 15 k1 to k13

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,840
region to better understand the full

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,800
spectrum of syndrome and to develop more

45
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,680
efficient treatment we generate a new

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,280
mouse model which carries a six megabase

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
large edition on the maternal

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,760
chromosome. This model represents over

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,920
70% of and syndrome patients making a

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,920
much closer to the typical clinical

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,920
presentation.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,720
So last time we shared the

53
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,000
neurobbehavioral differences between the

54
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,000
large leion and the obcomize.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,400
Today I will focus on what we have

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,360
learned from their EG recording how

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,440
their brain activity and sleep differ.

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
What that tells about uh of the

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,599
treatment development for and syndrome

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,640
using the EG as a biomarker.

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,840
We use the uh wireless EG transmitter

62
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,640
placed in a small subcutaneous pocket on

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,760
the back of each mice. Each transmitter

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,239
have four layers. Two EG lays positioned

65
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,480
to the skull to capture the activity

66
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,120
across entire cortex and two EMGs placed

67
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,640
on the tropetious muscles to monitor

68
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,599
muscle tone. By combining EG and EMG

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,440
signals, we could accurately assess both

70
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,400
seizure activity and sleep pattern.

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,360
Let's start with an example. Here's a 15

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,640
minutes uh EG snapshot from a white time

73
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,040
marks. You can see a stable consistent

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
baseline across all frequency band in

75
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,599
different color uh reflecting typical

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,959
brain activity under normal condition.

77
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,080
Next, this is an example of a cedar like

78
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,799
episode u composed of multiple spike

79
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,040
trains. These are the bursts of a highly

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,280
aptitude risma uh activity reflecting a

81
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,200
hypers synchronized discharge in the

82
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,720
cortex.

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,439
When we zoom in one of these spectrrens,

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,120
we can see a distinct onsite and

85
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,599
resolution, a sharp increase in delta za

86
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,639
and a beta power and a rhythmic

87
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,280
synchronization across a frequency bands

88
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,519
following a return to baseline. These

89
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,479
are classic features of generalized

90
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,680
seedl like events.

91
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,320
When we compare EEG across large leion

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,639
use knockout and the white time mice, we

93
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,199
found that the large leure mice showed

94
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,160
significantly more spike trends than

95
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,680
white type controls and their spike

96
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,320
occurs more often at night. The UB3

97
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,960
knock mice also had increased spike

98
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,240
activity compared to white type but much

99
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,479
less than large vision mice.

100
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,080
When we quantify those spike duration

101
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,199
and spike per second their indicators of

102
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:03,040
seure uh severity both are much higher

103
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,160
in the large leium mice. In the UB non

104
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:10,160
mice the spike trends were rare roughly

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,960
one shot uh event every 12 hours. um

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,320
lasting about one to two seconds. This

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,080
explains why many studies using the OB

108
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,039
in noncom that are recording AG for four

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,360
to six hours every day often miss these

110
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,800
rare events.

111
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,080
Next we examine the sleep patterns. Both

112
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,520
the large lean and obice

113
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,000
slept more at night than white controls.

114
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,680
Also our groups took similar daytime

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,240
naps. However, the quality of nighttime

116
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,800
sleep was very different.

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,840
The large leium mice had the longest

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,120
resting wake apparas, meaning they were

119
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,960
awake but not fully alert, reflecting

120
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,800
lighter and less restorative sleep. Both

121
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,000
mutton groups showed a a shorter active

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,639
w active wave PRS compared to whiteab

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,840
especially large leion.

124
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,800
When we broke this down by sleep stage,

125
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,160
slow web sleep which indicated the deep

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,440
sleep uh was more disrupted in the large

127
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
leium mice. While the paradoxical sleep

128
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,479
show different changes in the true

129
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,919
groups but is a large likely influenced

130
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,919
by the nighttime surgery event.

131
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,479
When we visualize the sleep stage

132
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,800
transition, we found that both mutton

133
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
lines and the frequent transitions

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,120
between stage and night a clear uh sun

135
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,680
are fragmented sleep. In contrast, the

136
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
white tub showed a stable consolidated

137
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,880
sleep.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,680
Interesting. Um, during the daytime,

139
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,880
sleep architecture was more comparable

140
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,440
among all groups and the OB knockice

141
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,000
were even applied slight slightly more

142
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,880
alert.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
When we look at the EG rhythms and power

144
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,319
spectrum, here's an example of a 12-hour

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,720
daytime EG in the white time to on top.

146
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,840
You can see normal distinction of delta

147
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,800
power in red, the alpha power in green

148
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,840
and beta power in yellow. In the large

149
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,199
leium mice to on the bottom, the delta

150
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,680
power in red was dramatically increased

151
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,080
while the alpha power in green and beta

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,800
power in yellow is remarkably reduced.

153
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,360
When we extracted and and compared those

154
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,160
specific frequency bands, we found

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,960
increased delta power only significant

156
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
in large leium mice but not in the UB

157
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,840
knockout.

158
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,880
The reduced alpha sigma and beta power

159
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,080
in both models but more pronounced in

160
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,280
the large leium mice. This pattern

161
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,000
highly delta, low alpha and beta match

162
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,280
the EG signatures in androma syndrome

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,599
patients suggesting the large vision um

164
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,680
model better capture the human

165
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,160
phenotypes.

166
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,599
To summarize this part, seizure

167
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,800
susceptibility was highest in large mice

168
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,680
moderate in the UB3 knockout. Sleep

169
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,400
architecture was fragmented in both and

170
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,840
syndrome mouse model. The AG power

171
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,400
spectrum changes in crisis of delta rad

172
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,520
alpha sigma and beta was only seen in

173
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,000
the large leium mice aligning with human

174
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,279
eg patterns.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,760
Next we apply our step R&P the crisper

176
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,519
based gene editing therapy to the large

177
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,080
leure mice. We treated two groups, one

178
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,279
at postnatal day one and another at the

179
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,959
postnatal day 21 and compare them with

180
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,920
untrade later base and wab controls. The

181
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,080
EG was recorded at six months and one

182
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,240
year of age.

183
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,959
We found the step R&P significantly rad

184
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,600
susceptibility in both postnatal day one

185
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,000
and postnatal day 21s

186
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
at six months age. On the day one

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,839
treatise already show [snorts] a strong

188
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,880
reduction in spike trains duration and

189
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,760
spike per seconds which indicated the

190
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,760
reduction in both seedure frequency and

191
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,800
severity

192
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
by one year. The day 21 mice still

193
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,959
maintain its improvements.

194
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,920
As for the sleep, step RP treatment

195
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,040
reduced resting wake duration and

196
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:41,920
paradoxic sleep uh duration

197
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,959
and increase the weight uh active awake

198
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,519
and slow wave sleep indicating more

199
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,600
consolidated sleep by just six months

200
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,399
after the treatment.

201
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,279
By the one year the day one treated a

202
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,560
mice showed extended slow wave sleep

203
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,680
compared to white type level despite a

204
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,240
confounding factor of aging.

205
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,279
When we visualize uh the sleep stage

206
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:10,000
transition treat mice showed a fewer

207
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,080
fragmented transition at night

208
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,480
approaching the stable patterns of a

209
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,880
white tab at six months after treatment

210
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,440
man. At one year, the day 21 titanomize

211
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,000
showed sleep state transition pattern

212
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,640
nearly identical to the Y type

213
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,800
indicating a delayed yet progressive

214
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,040
restoration of neurosircuit

215
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,200
organization.

216
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Similar pattern also observed during the

217
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,399
daytime recording.

218
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,959
By one year of age, the steep transition

219
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,880
between traed large leion and the white

220
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:48,880
high pers are nearly indistinguishable

221
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,760
in easy reasons power the K biomarker

222
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,160
was significantly reduced after the

223
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,880
treatment in both groups. The day one

224
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,959
trait mice match the white level by just

225
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
six months of six months after

226
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
treatment.

227
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,959
Meanwhile, both the day one and day 21

228
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,600
trader groups showed a significant

229
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,560
increase in alpha power. And in day one

230
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,680
trade group, the alpha power was fully

231
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,240
restored to the white type level.

232
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,800
By one year, the therapeutic effect

233
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,680
still maintain and the delta power of

234
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,279
the day 21 trait mice are even at the

235
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,640
same as white. During the daytime,

236
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,200
the day 21 treated the mice showed even

237
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,399
higher of alpha powers than white

238
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,720
controls suggesting an enhanced cortical

239
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,959
synchronization even with delayed

240
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,800
treatment and confounding factor of

241
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,880
aging.

242
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,920
Therefore, we summarize the second

243
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,600
section. The step RP treatment reduce

244
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,240
seizure frequency, duration and severity

245
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,760
in both early stage and later stage

246
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,959
treatment.

247
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,760
It improves sleep quality, restored more

248
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,959
stable sleep pattern and normalized e

249
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,839
rhythms towards white level.

250
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,639
Overall, this data demonstrate that the

251
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,360
new large leion mouse model provides a

252
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,200
much more comprehensive and clinical

253
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:18,000
relevant representation of and syndrome.

254
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,399
It recapulated the key neurological

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,279
features observing the patients with

256
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,440
large leion including increasure

257
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,320
susceptibility disrupt sleep

258
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,200
architecture and the distinct age rhythm

259
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,160
changes of and syndrome

260
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,000
by capturing those broader phenotypes

261
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,720
that traditional UB3 a mice um missed.

262
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,519
This large leion model serve as a power

263
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,959
tool for understanding the full genetic

264
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:50,320
contribution of the 15 Q11 to Q1 region

265
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,959
Q13 region and for the testing future

266
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,839
therapeutics under condition that more

267
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,279
closely to mirror the majority of

268
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:02,560
syndrome patients. Ultimately, this new

269
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,040
MOS model brings us one more step closer

270
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,680
to the translate translation discovery

271
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,760
in the lab into meaningful improvement

272
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
for the families living with and

273
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,000
syndrome.

274
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,040
Beyond today's topic, I'm excited to

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,240
share news. We recently generated the

276
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,880
first asupdia mouse model which carries

277
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
a six macbased deletion on the maternal

278
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,040
chromosone and a six macbased

279
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,279
duplication on the paternal chromone.

280
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,880
mimicking the ASUPD

281
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,959
ASUPD form. This I uh this idea actually

282
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,360
come from one of your questions last

283
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,200
time. If there's a gold model and

284
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,639
treatment developed for the large

285
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,800
leation, what about UPD? We are now

286
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,279
conducting baseline behavior test on

287
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,320
this new model and I'm looking forward

288
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,480
to share the results with you soon.

289
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,360
At the end, I'd like to thank my mentor

290
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,120
Dr. Jang and our lab member close

291
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,719
collaborator Joe Lab and founding

292
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,739
support.

293
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,739
[applause]

294
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,440
I said no more models and there she

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,000
goes. She made another model. Um no we

296
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,199
we um purposefully wanted to ensure that

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,959
as we think about the genes outside of

298
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,720
UB3A we also think about the genes in

299
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,040
UPD and ICD. That's incredibly

300
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,199
important. Um, so, so really I know that

301
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,199
was a whirlwind and probably very few of

302
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,800
you really captured the significance of

303
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,519
that and I'm going to summarize it in

304
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,600
one sentence which essentially is that

305
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
they made a model that is more

306
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,519
significantly impaired than the

307
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,839
traditional Angelman knockout model

308
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,839
which is just the UB3A. But what they

309
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,880
also showed is when they put crisper in

310
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,360
to just edit UB3A, they actually

311
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,959
corrected almost all of the phenotypes.

312
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
But what's more important than that,

313
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,600
what it tells us is that that model may

314
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,760
not distinguish the specific between

315
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,160
nonUB3 genes and UV3 genes in

316
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,440
correction. But what it will tell us is

317
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,680
that again they repeated the fact that

318
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,360
they were able to rescue phenotype

319
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,480
almost equally if not equally in the

320
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,399
newborn mice as they were in a P21 mouse

321
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,880
which would be an adolescent a teenager

322
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,680
mouse. And ultimately what they found

323
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,000
was over time at six months and at one

324
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,040
year that correction got better and

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,720
better for the older animals which is

326
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,360
something we believe is probably true

327
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,839
for humans. Right? It may take more time

328
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,600
for an adult or an adolescent to see the

329
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,760
same benefit as a 2-year-old or a

330
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,760
one-year-old. But we have all the time

331
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,320
in the world. We've just been waiting.

332
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,079
So it's okay if it takes more time. But

333
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,399
it may have to drive the fact that in a

334
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,399
clinical trial environment, we can't be

335
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,399
cutting these trials off too early

336
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,880
because we may see the best of benefit

337
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,199
over time. And so for me, that's what I

338
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,279
learned from that presentation. And I

339
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,000
hope that you can take that home as real

340
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,360
success and really good information as

341
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we think about discovering drug

342
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,000
development.
