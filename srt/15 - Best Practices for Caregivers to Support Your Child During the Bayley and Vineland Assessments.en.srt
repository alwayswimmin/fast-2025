1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Our next speakers um we actually have

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,880
two even though only one is in the

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,000
agenda. It's um Ann Wheeler who's going

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,520
to be with us virtually because

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,280
unfortunately at the last minute she

6
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,639
couldn't join us but we have Angelie

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,080
Sadwani who's going to come and they're

8
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,599
going to split the presentation and

9
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
they're going to talk to us about best

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,439
practices to support your child during

11
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,359
the Bailey and the vin assessments and

12
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,960
that is very important in clinical

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,080
trials particularly because some of

14
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
these measures are going to be the

15
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,400
primary endpoint. So really getting the

16
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,560
best possible data is absolutely

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,439
critical. So with that, Anelie, come on

18
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
up. And if we can bring up

19
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,399
>> Ann. Great.

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,399
>> Thank you.

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,960
>> Thanks so much, Alison. While Anelie is

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,360
coming up, I'm not sure if you can hear

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,719
me, but I wanted to um say I'm very

24
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,640
sorry that I'm not there with you all

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,039
today. Um but I will be there tomorrow.

26
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,000
So I hope to um see many of you at the

27
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,320
gala.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
So, um, Angelina and I wanted to spend

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,840
some time and talk to you all about what

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,520
the best practices are for you if your

31
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,159
child is participating in a clinical

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,840
trial and you are in the room watching a

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,640
Bailey or you're being asked to do a

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,520
violin.

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,960
So, as Allison mentioned and as you've

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,119
heard throughout the day programming, um

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,080
we have multiple clinical trials that

38
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,640
are either ongoing or in process of

39
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,200
being started. And all of these trials

40
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,720
are going to use rigorous methods um to

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,360
ensure that treatment safety and

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,040
effectiveness are are the primary um of

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,079
primary importance. And so it's going to

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
be um critical that those of us who are

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
doing some of the assessments and

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
helping support the trials um really

47
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,840
adhere strictly to the rules and

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,040
administrative pro protocols. And this

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
can be frustrating sometimes for

50
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
families because you may hear us say

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,000
things that sound kind of awkward or

52
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,680
you're like, "Oh, I wish you would say

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
it a different way." Um just

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,439
unfortunately the way we have to do it

55
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,719
is very standardized and it can it can

56
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,000
um uh not always make the most sense to

57
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,920
a parent. So we wanted to make sure to

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,680
note that. Um, as you've heard,

59
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,240
improving cognition, communication, and

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,840
motor skills are major goals um for all

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,319
of our current and emerging treatments

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,480
for Angelmen syndrome. And the clinical

63
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,720
outcome assessments that we administer

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,319
are really key. These are essential for

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,080
us knowing if the drug is making a

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239
difference for the individual and for

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,680
you as a family member. And if we have

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,680
the wrong assessment or if the

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
administration is done wrong or if the

70
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
information that's provided isn't

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
accurate, it can actually increase the

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,680
chance of the trial failing. And this is

73
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
true even if the treatment actually

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
really does work. And so we want to be

75
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,000
very very careful that the way we do

76
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,080
these assessments is um accurate and uh

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
comprehensive. So the two measures that

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,959
we're going to talk about today are the

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,480
Bailey scales of infant de and toddler

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,000
development and the vinand adaptive

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,120
behavior skills. Both of which you've

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,280
probably heard much about. So the Bailey

83
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
is a direct performance-based assessment

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
of core developmental skills. So these

85
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,080
are things like um early cognition,

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,480
language, both receptive and expressive,

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,000
and motor. So both fine and gross motor.

88
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,440
These are all similar to the same skills

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,959
you just heard Sarah talk about, but

90
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,080
these are things that we're directly

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,599
assessing in the room. Um and so the

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,200
things that we're do with the child on

93
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,120
the Bailey are really trying to help us

94
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,280
understand how the individual problem

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
solves and uses things like spatial

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,879
visual spatial skills, symbolic

97
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,959
representation, and object permanence in

98
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
order to approach novel tasks. And it

99
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,159
actually takes quite a bit of training

100
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
in order to learn how to administer this

101
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,159
test um and how to make sure that you're

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,799
getting the best response from it.

103
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,280
Um the reason we use the Bailey is multi

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,440
there's multiple reasons. Um the main

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,440
reason is that it does not rely heavily

106
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,040
on things like verbal skills or motor

107
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,720
planning both of which are challenges

108
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
for individuals with Angelmen syndrome.

109
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,799
So we know that every individual with

110
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,319
Angelmen can do some items on the Bailey

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,879
which allows us to have a starting point

112
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,640
by which we can see some growth. Um the

113
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,440
Bailey has been shown to be sensitive to

114
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,840
change um in response to development as

115
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,680
well as response to treatments. And the

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
most important thing for us right now is

117
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
that we have lots and lots of data to

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
help us understand the natural

119
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
trajectory of individuals with Angelmen

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,200
on this measure. Um and so because it's

121
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,599
being used in the clinical trials, we

122
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,840
have a nice comparison group um to be

123
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,160
able to look at relative to the

124
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,680
treatment.

125
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
So one of the things that I think is

126
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
important to understand is that when

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
we're assessing with the Bailey, we're

128
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,400
actually assessing foundational skills

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
that are really critical for the

130
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,400
development of higher order skills that

131
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
we use in our daily life for say

132
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,800
activities of daily living or academic

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,199
learning or regul regulating our

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,840
behaviors. And it really starts with the

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,000
exploration we have with our senses um

136
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,479
and our movement in the world. And we

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
interact with the world and and start to

138
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,919
develop these additional skills. We

139
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,479
develop we develop attention to certain

140
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
things. We learn about cause and effect.

141
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,160
Um we and then because we have cause and

142
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,600
effect and object permanence and visual

143
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,440
attention, we start to be able to do

144
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,479
things like problem solve and imitate

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,919
and develop uh play skills. Um and then

146
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,160
ultimately develop this concept

147
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,160
acquisition that leads to more academic

148
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,160
learning. And while this is sort of

149
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
developed in generally developed in a

150
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
linear fashion, we do know that

151
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
individuals with Angelmen are not

152
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
necessarily gaining these skills in a

153
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,120
linear fashion. We see um kids who have

154
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,199
great memory skills but really can't

155
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,639
imitate. And so um we're trying to look

156
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,400
at all of these types of skills on the

157
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,240
Bailey in order to help us understand

158
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,919
where there may be rooms for growth.

159
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
So, just to give a little example of

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,680
those sort of foundational cognitive

161
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
skills and how they play out in daily

162
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,440
life, um, let's say you have a child

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,240
that wants to get his favorite snack

164
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,600
from the top of a closed cabinet. What

165
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,199
kind of skills would the child need to

166
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,720
be able to do that? Well, they would

167
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,720
need object permanence. They would need

168
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
to know that that object, that snack,

169
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,400
exists even when they can't see it. They

170
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,120
would need to have memory. They would

171
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,680
need to know remember that that snack is

172
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,360
on top of a cabinet. they would need to

173
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,199
come up with some sort of way to solve

174
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
the problem. And in this case, they may

175
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,199
use imitation because they've seen their

176
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,120
mom or another person bring a chair

177
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,120
over, climb up on the chair in order to

178
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,960
obtain something high. And so, they want

179
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,080
to go ahead and imitate that to uh

180
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,080
problem solve this this situation.

181
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
So, um we're going to go through some

182
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,360
things we want you um as caregivers to

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,880
remember about the Bailey administration

184
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
and then we're going to do some dos and

185
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,479
don'ts. So, as far as in BA

186
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,759
administration goes, it's really

187
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,840
important to remember that we're going

188
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
to be using materials and toys that were

189
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,120
designed for younger individuals for

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,840
infants and toddlers.

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,520
Um, and as I noted before, um, the

192
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,120
examiners will have to maintain

193
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
standardization and so there will be

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,880
very specific ways in which we have to

195
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,720
present the material and ask questions.

196
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,960
The materials that we're using are

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
intended to evoke interest and assess

198
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,720
how your your loved one with Angelmen

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,319
engages with the materials and objects.

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,080
We know we're not probably going to be

201
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,720
getting peak performance and so that's

202
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,720
not really our intention.

203
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
Um so what we're really trying to

204
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,520
understand is what the child can do

205
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,080
independently which means we really want

206
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,080
to be limiting um any sort of prompts or

207
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,080
coaching.

208
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
And we want to be very clear in

209
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
acknowledging that for every single

210
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
child that takes this test, there are

211
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,319
going to be some tasks that are easy and

212
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,080
there are going to be some tasks that

213
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,680
are difficult. And there will be some

214
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,800
tasks that are motivating and there will

215
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,800
be some tasks that are not motivating.

216
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,240
We don't expect all individuals to do

217
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,759
every single thing we we put in front of

218
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,479
them. That is not an expectation of

219
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,479
anybody on this test.

220
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,080
And we want to make very clear that you

221
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,599
as a caregiver who is accompanying your

222
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
child to this assessment are really

223
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,599
critical to an access successful

224
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,520
administration. And this is m for

225
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,520
multiple reasons. One of which being

226
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,000
that you provide necessary information

227
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,080
and behavior support for your child and

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,840
also for the examiner to be able to use

229
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,160
strategies that will help your child

230
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,560
provide their best performance. And in

231
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
addition to that, you are a trusted,

232
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,520
calming, and safe presence for your

233
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,759
child, which is absolutely critical,

234
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,199
especially when there is an anxiety

235
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,199
producing situation like being assessed.

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,319
So, we have some dues, things we want

237
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,479
you, we really want you as a caregiver

238
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,479
to do when you come for the a we do want

239
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,280
you to ensure your child is well rested

240
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,039
and fed before they come for testing. We

241
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
want to make sure that you um have

242
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,240
informed the examiner if there's

243
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,160
anything that's off about your child

244
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,599
that day. It doesn't mean we have to

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,360
stop the test, but it helps us

246
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,639
understand um whether or not we really

247
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
are getting the best performance from

248
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,640
your child.

249
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
We really want you to show as much

250
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,800
enthusiasm as you can about the

251
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,320
activities um in front of your child. We

252
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,680
don't want them to feel like you don't

253
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,200
think that this is a good thing for them

254
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,880
for you them to be doing.

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
We want you to encourage your child to

256
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,800
participate and engage with the

257
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,040
examiner.

258
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,120
We want you to bring motivating items or

259
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,760
snacks that we can use to help reinforce

260
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,519
them.

261
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,440
We want you to help. We want you to

262
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,600
share any sort of helpful behavior

263
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,519
strategies that you know work with your

264
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,560
child. Please share those with us so we

265
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,720
can try them out.

266
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,480
We want you to let us know if your child

267
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
needs a break. Sometimes we know very

268
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,360
clearly they need a break and sometimes

269
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,360
we're just we don't know your child as

270
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,440
well as you do. We need you to tell us.

271
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,279
And please answer any of the examiner's

272
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,000
questions as honestly and accurately as

273
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,399
possible.

274
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
And after the session, we will ask you

275
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
to tell us about your child's

276
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,480
performance and how much the child's

277
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,920
performance uh reflects what you see in

278
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,519
day-to-day life or if they were really

279
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,959
just very off. We want to know that.

280
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,519
So, there are some things we definitely

281
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,279
don't want you to do.

282
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,080
We don't want you to provide hints or

283
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,360
clues on any items unless we ask you

284
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,120
explicitly to do so.

285
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,720
We don't want you to distract your child

286
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,959
unless we're asking you to redirect

287
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,399
them.

288
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,720
We don't want you to help your child

289
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,640
complete any task unless exam again we

290
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
are explicitly asking you to do that.

291
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,880
Please don't use any punishments or

292
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
threats.

293
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,959
Please don't show anxiety or

294
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
disappointment. Um, as much as you can,

295
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,240
even if you feel disappointment, try to

296
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,399
hide that in the in the moment.

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,920
And please don't defer to us. If you

298
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,680
think your child needs a break or is

299
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,360
becoming increasingly agitated and you

300
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,279
don't see the examiner taking action,

301
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,959
please let us know. We want to hear from

302
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,560
you about what your child needs.

303
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,000
>> And now, um, Angelie is going to take

304
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,519
over and talk a little bit more about

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,959
what we would like you to do when it

306
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,959
comes to the alignment.

307
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
>> Thank you so much, An. Can you all hear

308
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,360
me? Okay, great. So, I'm going to be

309
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,519
talking about about the wine. Sarah

310
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,279
already provided a great overview of it.

311
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,200
It assesses functioning in day-to-day

312
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,560
life. It's specifically interested in

313
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,640
what a child individual can do

314
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,640
independently on their own to take care

315
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,959
of themselves and interact with others.

316
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,800
It's used in several studies in

317
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,560
syndrome. There are several domains that

318
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,480
are assessed. communication which is

319
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,800
receptive and expressive communication,

320
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,399
written skills, their activities of

321
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
daily living, how they take care of

322
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,000
themselves, what kind of things do they

323
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,839
do in their home, their socialization

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,079
skills, how they get along with others,

325
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,480
and their fine and gross motor skills.

326
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,480
The vin administration is conducted as

327
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,600
an interview between the examiner and a

328
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,880
caregiver who knows the individual well.

329
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
What are some of the things you want to

330
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
keep in mind when you do the vin

331
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,600
interview?

332
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,560
We're going to be asking you questions

333
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,200
about skills both above and below your

334
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,959
child's level. So, be prepared for that.

335
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,760
We want to get a sense of how your child

336
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,240
is doing independently on their own

337
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,839
without helper support. When you're

338
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,279
thinking about your responses, think

339
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,360
about all the ways your child

340
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,399
communicates, their sounds, their

341
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
gestures, their ASC device.

342
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,480
The Wand is essentially a dialogue

343
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,640
between you and the clinician. We're

344
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,079
trying to get a comprehensive picture of

345
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,279
your child's functioning across domains.

346
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,440
So, what are some of the things that you

347
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,519
do want to keep in mind while doing it?

348
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
In terms of scheduling the interview,

349
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,480
you want to schedule the interview at a

350
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,399
time where you can be focused and

351
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,440
engaged. The interview typically lasts

352
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,120
an hour. Choose a quiet environment to

353
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,399
minimize distractions during the

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,079
interview.

355
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,600
If your child is present, have

356
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,040
activities to keep them entertained or

357
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
someone else to keep them entertained so

358
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,120
you're not juggling the child and

359
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,240
managing the interview at the same time.

360
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,959
When responding, answer each question as

361
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,040
honestly and accurately as possible.

362
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,680
Focus on the child's current skills,

363
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
what the child does do right now.

364
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,880
Reflect on what your child does do

365
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
without prompting or support and what

366
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,720
they do need help with support and

367
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,320
prompting.

368
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,519
Consider your child's behavior in

369
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
different settings. They may be

370
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,120
different at home and school in social

371
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,040
environments.

372
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,959
Given a sense of how frequently the

373
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,480
behavior occurs, whether it occurs

374
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,600
sometimes, whether it occurs all the

375
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,079
time, provide specific examples to

376
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,079
illustrate your point. Ask for

377
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,079
clarifications if questions if a

378
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,360
question is unclear.

379
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,560
Tell the examiner if you need a break.

380
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,120
What are the things that we don't want

381
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,639
you during a vinand interview? We don't

382
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,800
want you to rush your answers. We just

383
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
don't want you to speed it up. We don't

384
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,920
want you to guess on any item. If you're

385
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,320
not sure, just discuss this with the

386
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,480
examiner. We don't want you to give g

387
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,959
vague or generalized responses. We

388
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,040
really want concrete examples.

389
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,839
Don't exaggerate or minimize your

390
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,760
child's skills. Don't base your answers

391
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,440
what you hope the child can do or what

392
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,040
they do did in the past. You we really

393
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,519
want to focus over the current skills

394
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,120
that your child does do.

395
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,880
We hope these guidelines are helpful to

396
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,320
you as you do the Bailey and the vin in

397
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,160
the clinical trials. And we want to

398
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,440
thank our team Sarah Potter and Bach

399
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,360
with all the help with the Bailey and

400
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,360
violent administration. Thank you.

401
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,519
That was great for both of you. You

402
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,000
know, we take so many of these and we

403
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,839
forget the importance of consistency and

404
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,760
and you really laid out beautifully how

405
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,480
we can best support our kids. And I have

406
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,959
to say I'm in I feel very guilty because

407
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
I you know I go into the Bailey and I

408
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,399
see the baby and I the first thing I say

409
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,120
is like oh my god not the creepy baby

410
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,880
and then Quincy throws the baby but like

411
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,079
maybe I made her throw the baby because

412
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,639
I hate the baby and I actually maybe

413
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,040
influence the test and that's wrong. I

414
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,120
should love the baby so that she loves

415
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,800
the baby. So going forward, nobody

416
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,079
called the baby the creepy baby because

417
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
it is a little bit of a creepy
