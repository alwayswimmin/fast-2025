1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,679
So I am actually the next speaker. So

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,680
I'm just going to stay here and

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,040
hopefully no one needs to introduce me.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,880
Um but here we go. So I was asked to

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,599
give a talk about understanding clinical

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,520
trials from a family perspective. I'm

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,520
not here to talk about regulatory and

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
I'm not here to talk about any of the

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,080
the true details from from a drug

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,880
developer perspective. I'm here mostly

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,519
to talk about how as a guide for

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,880
families the questions we should be

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,800
asking and how we can empower parents

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
through knowledge, hope and honestly

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,399
clinical trial etiquette. And uh many

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,440
people ask me to give the nitty-gritty

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,360
of of what parents need to know about

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,079
clinical trials, what they need to think

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,160
about from a parent perspective, not

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
from a sponsor perspective. So I am

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,039
wearing my parent hat. I am wearing my

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,719
fast hat. Um, but obviously as you know

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,719
I am the CSO of FASA the co-director of

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,000
Abomb the city of AS2 bio. But most

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,840
importantly the hat I'm wearing right

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,680
now is I am the mother to Quincy.

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
Here are my disclosures. Okay. So I

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
shouldn't have to tell you what a

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,400
clinical trial is, but there are a lot

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
of newly diagnosed families here in the

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,400
room and they may actually not really be

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,680
familiar with what it is and why. So

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,080
clinical trials um really test new drugs

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,040
or devices or different types of

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,040
therapies for safety and potential

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,840
efficacy or effectiveness. That's what a

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,360
clinical trial is. Each trial includes

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,759
spe like specific eligibility criteria.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,079
um basically that are selected with very

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,720
careful consideration of who should be

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,880
included in this clinical trial and for

42
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,280
what reason and and and that's called

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,280
inclusion or exclusion criteria which

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,280
I'll I'll talk a little bit about and

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,799
and that could be different things like

46
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,799
what is their age what is their genotype

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,719
what is their prior treatment exposure

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
what else have they seen in their body

49
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,119
that could interact with potentially

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
what we're trying to measure here what

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,399
other medications are they on what other

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,399
disorders might they have? These are all

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,040
very very important pieces that we have

54
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
to know about our children as we think

55
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,080
about enrolling them in a clinical

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,959
trial. So inclusion criteria means

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,120
what characteristics of a person must

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,680
they have to be eligible to be in that

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,680
specific clinical trial? And really it

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,000
defines who can participate in that

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,720
trial. On the other hand, there's

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,080
exclusion criteria which essentially

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,000
defines who disqualifies, who cannot be

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,239
included in that clinical trial. And

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,400
those decisions generally are not made

66
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,200
because anyone wants to exclude anyone.

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,760
we're the most inclusive, of course. Um,

68
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,080
but it's because maybe that person with

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
whatever other things going on in their

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
life, whether it's a genotype, whether

71
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,879
it's an age, whether it's other

72
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,319
medications that they're on, whether

73
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,760
it's any other condition that they might

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,000
have, really are deemed to not be the

75
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,080
perfect candidate for these early

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
studies in which we would be testing

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,360
some type of drug or biologic or or

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,680
device. Um, so there are these inclusion

79
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,440
criteria which you must meet and these

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,840
are there are these exclusion criteria

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,040
which could disqualify you. It doesn't

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
mean you're disqualified from

83
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,840
everything. It just means you you may be

84
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,120
disqualified from that specific trial at

85
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,280
that specific time. And as sponsors

86
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,599
learn more and more about their drug,

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
they're going to include more and more

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,080
over time because they're going to

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,360
broaden their um the view in which

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,519
they're looking at their therapeutic.

91
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Clinical trials are conducted under very

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,400
strict regulatory oversight. And so you

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,159
have to be very precise. You have to be

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,799
very careful. And parents that means

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,239
have to follow the rules. They have to

96
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,400
show up when they're supposed to show

97
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,000
up. they have to report what they're

98
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
supposed to report and let's go through

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,920
that as a parent. What's really

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,599
important for you to understand? Um, so

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,040
why you may say like why do we have to

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
do clinical trials if there's a drug?

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,000
Why can't all people get them? Well,

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,440
clinical trials test safety and the

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,840
potential improvement or lack of

106
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,080
improvement in the lives of people

107
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,960
affected with a disorder like Angelman

108
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,759
syndrome. And so these trials may be may

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,600
be conducted to understand how a new

110
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,919
technology behaves in people which means

111
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
there's risk and there's potential

112
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,120
benefit but everybody needs to

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,840
understand that each participant and

114
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,240
their family are incredibly brave if

115
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,000
they are contributing to advancing the

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,199
science understanding they are taking a

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,280
major risk of the unknown And that is

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,000
not for everyone. It is not for the

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,759
faint of heart. And it is a very serious

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,680
commitment that families have to be

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,120
prepared for.

122
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,320
The parents of our children are the true

123
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,000
partners in the discovery effort to

124
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,240
understand

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,639
drugs and how they work. Their

126
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,919
commitment to the requirements of these

127
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,800
clinical trials cannot be underestimated

128
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,880
and is incredibly prudent in order to be

129
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,360
successful in these therapies.

130
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,639
Parents need to be able to ask

131
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,960
questions. They need to understand what

132
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,680
is expected of them. They need to

133
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
understand what is going to happen step

134
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,520
by step in their child. And they need to

135
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,479
carefully listen to the required

136
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,240
schedule which is called the schedule of

137
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,320
assessments,

138
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,120
the expectations of their participation

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
and the potential risk of their

140
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
participation.

141
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,479
And I can tell you that I know a lot of

142
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,600
parents that get information about

143
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,880
trials before they enroll on an informed

144
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,160
consent, which we're going to talk

145
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:13,680
about, don't even read it. They don't

146
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,840
listen because they're so excited that

147
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,880
they sign it.

148
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,440
You have to read it. You have to listen

149
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,639
to the doctors and you have to pay

150
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,880
attention and ask questions because you

151
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,360
are signing something that could be

152
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,960
risky to your child. This is real. The

153
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
fact that we're even talking about this

154
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,120
is so exciting. But this is real and

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,000
there is real potential for benefit, but

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,680
there is real potential for risk. And as

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
we are in these early stage programs,

158
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,039
until we have a lot more information,

159
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,360
you have to read it. You have to ask

160
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,720
questions. And so I don't think I need

161
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
to tell anybody about the phases of

162
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
clinical trials, right? But what I want

163
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,840
to share is you heard yesterday about

164
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,160
really what we call phase zero, which is

165
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,080
like all the pre-clinical stuff, all of

166
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,160
the animal work, all of the things we

167
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,360
need to prove that we can get to first

168
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,360
in human. Then there's the early phase,

169
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
phase one often mixed with phase two in

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,720
rare disease where it's a small number

171
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,319
of participants. Gene therapy trials may

172
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,880
be six people, nine people, 12 people,

173
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:23,280
very very very small numbers of people

174
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,960
to understand safety and dose

175
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,520
durability effect. All of those things

176
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,280
are are hopefully determined in those

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,639
early stage programs as you saw with the

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,360
ASOS. Those ASO phase one two studies

179
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,240
went on for years before they moved into

180
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,240
the pivotal which is your phase three.

181
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,360
Your phase three generally recruits more

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,440
numbers of participants having a a

183
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,080
bigger track record of the understanding

184
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,160
of a drug or a biologic.

185
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,759
A lot more information will be given to

186
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,400
you about that drug or biologic because

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,240
a lot more has been learned in the human

188
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,879
space. And in those trials, sometimes

189
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,800
there's what we call a control, meaning

190
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,680
some patients get the drug and some

191
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,199
patients don't get the drug to compare

192
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,160
against

193
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,919
treatment and no treatment. In some

194
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,560
phase three studies, there isn't a

195
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,280
control because, for example, in a gene

196
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,080
therapy, you can't actually put a needle

197
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,639
in the skull behind the skull and

198
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,720
deliver saline. You you can't do that.

199
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,199
that's not really would be considered

200
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,159
ethical. So there are certain ways in

201
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,479
which you can't do a controlled study

202
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,599
easily, but you might be able to do a

203
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:39,039
sham study more easily. And so you have

204
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,440
to realize different studies are going

205
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,880
to look a little different um because

206
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
there are some things you can and can't

207
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,000
do for for permanent treatment

208
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,640
therapies. And you saw this yesterday

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,800
where we have multiple programs and

210
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,200
clinical trials, six programs and

211
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,720
clinical trials currently and they're

212
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,519
all in different phases, but we have

213
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:04,480
three more programs that are coming into

214
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,080
this space hopefully in the coming years

215
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,480
and multiple behind that. Our AV gene

216
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,040
therapy, you heard about

217
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,839
our ASOS, our HSC gene therapy,

218
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,360
hopefully very soon. Our ASOS are now in

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,839
phase three, so they're in the

220
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,600
controlled phase.

221
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,800
Our crisper gene editor you just heard

222
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,399
about is hopefully going to be in a

223
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,480
phase one, two in the in the near term.

224
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,399
Small molecules, sir, mirna, we we heard

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,640
um a bit about that from encoded the

226
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,240
other day uh from Emma on yesterday,

227
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
yesterday morning and hopefully we'll

228
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,480
hear more about from them next year. And

229
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,560
then some of the small molecules, some

230
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,440
of the downstream targets like a loabbat

231
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,200
from RO or the neuron drug. These are

232
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,519
all in different phases and they're all

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,080
going to look quite different because

234
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,680
they have different risk profiles and

235
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,519
they're going to include different types

236
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,600
of patients for various different

237
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,360
reasons. And so the steps to enrollment,

238
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,080
this is quite complicated. There are

239
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,480
multiple different steps. One, you have

240
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,959
to find the trial. Two, there's this

241
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,839
pre-screening period. Then there's a

242
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,399
screening visit. Then you have to read

243
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,800
an informed consent.

244
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,880
Then you enroll. Then you have to do

245
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,920
baseline assessments to understand where

246
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,160
your child is starting from. Then they

247
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,120
participate in the study and they they

248
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,440
hopefully get a study drug and then you

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,240
have to do a lot of followup and a lot

250
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,640
of you know understanding of the safety

251
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,480
and the potential efficacy. So there is

252
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,160
an incredible amount that goes into

253
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,160
this. So how do you find a trial?

254
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,240
The best place to find a trial is on

255
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,600
clinical trials.gov. Jennifer did a

256
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,920
really great presentation a couple years

257
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,959
ago about this. So you go on clinical

258
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,959
trials.gov www.clinicaltrials.gov.

259
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
You type in Angelmen Syndrome and it has

260
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,200
all of the clinical trials that are

261
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,760
either open for enrollment or recruiting

262
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,760
for enrollment on the trial or that are

263
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,640
are part of the the study and that might

264
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,200
be enrolling. That's where you find the

265
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,760
sites. That's where you find who to

266
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,160
contact if you are interested in hearing

267
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,399
more. That's not how you enroll. It's

268
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
how you know what's available and how

269
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,160
you contact the sites if you want to

270
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,640
hear more. The other places that you'll

271
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,440
get that information is at the advocacy

272
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,839
group advocacy group level. So at the

273
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,680
fast website, at the ASF website, and we

274
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,320
try to collaborate and work together to

275
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,040
alert the community in the newsletters,

276
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,079
on social media about sites that are

277
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,519
opening or trials that are recruiting,

278
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,200
but you are going to need to do some of

279
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,120
the leg work yourself and you should

280
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
look regularly if you're interested on

281
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,640
clinical trials.gov.

282
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,240
You want to then discuss the the the

283
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,120
consideration and the interest with your

284
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,519
neurologist or clinical care team to

285
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,200
decide if this is appropriate for you as

286
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:05,120
a family and for your child. Is that

287
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,120
specific trial suitable for you? There's

288
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,800
many things you may not know about it

289
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,519
that you're going to learn as you talk

290
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,959
to some of the doctors. If you decide

291
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,920
that this is something you would like

292
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,399
more information on, you can contact the

293
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,040
trial site at clinicaltrials.gov or the

294
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,040
sponsor sometimes has a generalized

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,320
website where you can contact them and

296
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,639
then they will connect you to the

297
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,800
clinical trial sites that are closest to

298
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,920
you in your region, in your state,

299
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,320
wherever wherever you are globally. Then

300
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,880
you want to inquire about all of the

301
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,200
options, not just one that your child

302
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,800
might be eligible for. Don't just jump

303
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,120
on the first thing you see, a gene

304
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,880
therapy, because maybe there's an ASO

305
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,880
that's available that your child could

306
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,399
qualify for. Maybe there's a crisper

307
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,320
gene editor that's available that your

308
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,560
child could qualify for. You want to

309
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,720
know all of the options. Remember,

310
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,279
knowledge is power. You need to

311
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,760
understand all of your options.

312
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:04,160
Understand the differences to make an

313
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,440
educated decision for your child. And is

314
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,160
that trial right for you? You need to

315
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,720
understand all of that. If you decide a

316
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,200
trial you think you're really interested

317
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,600
in and you determine you think is right

318
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,279
for you, then you're going to contact

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,720
the site and you're going to talk to the

320
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,519
site and they're going to do what we

321
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,320
call a pre-screening. That pre-screening

322
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,040
is where the study team will contact you

323
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,519
for an initial review of your child's

324
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,920
medical history. That can include all

325
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,800
sorts of things. It could be done by the

326
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,360
phone. It could be done by email or it

327
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,800
could be done in person.

328
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,399
And they're going to ask you a lot of

329
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,760
questions

330
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,399
trying to figure out if your child fits

331
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,000
the basic inclusion or exclusion

332
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
criteria.

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,240
Are they are they meeting those

334
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,800
criteria? Does your child actually

335
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,680
qualify? And if it is determined that

336
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,320
they qualify, then they're going to ask

337
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
to share more medical records to confirm

338
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,279
that, which might include some

339
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,040
laboratory test results. So, you want to

340
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,199
have access to that. What is their

341
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,519
genetic test results? Do you have their

342
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,279
diagnosis of their genetics? Is it a

343
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,399
deletion because someone told you it's a

344
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,040
deletion? Or do you have a piece of

345
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,920
paper that says it's a deletion? Is it a

346
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,079
mutation? Is it UPD? Is it ICD? What are

347
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,880
the genetic tests that were done? get

348
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,440
access to that information and have that

349
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,360
at the ready so you can send that to the

350
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,760
sites. They're going to want you to

351
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,560
share those laboratory results, prior

352
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,600
testing information, understanding their

353
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,320
age, your location, where you live, and

354
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
any other problems they have. Don't hide

355
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,240
those things because you're worried they

356
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,160
won't be included because it might not

357
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,240
be safe for your child if they have

358
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,160
something else going on. Do they have

359
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,480
any associated heart disease? Do they

360
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,959
have any associated kidney disease? Do

361
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,360
they have diabetes, hypertension? Are

362
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,600
they mobile? Don't like, well, my child

363
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,279
can walk from the couch to the TV and

364
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,800
back to the couch, but they never walk

365
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,199
throughout the rest of the day and they

366
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,920
generally are in a push chair. They're

367
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,760
not considered fully ambulatory. You

368
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,920
have to be honest about that because the

369
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,320
reason ambulatory matters could be for

370
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,240
safety reasons and you want to ensure

371
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,440
that your child really fits in the right

372
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,440
criteria for those studies. So then if

373
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,800
it's determined that things are looking

374
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
good for that child, you're going to

375
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,480
have a screening visit. You're going to

376
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,639
go to the site. You're going to meet the

377
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,120
study doctor and you're going to spend

378
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,639
time talking to that person about what's

379
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,000
going to happen over the course of the

380
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,760
study and the details of the study, the

381
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,120
eligibility, the inclusion, the

382
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,120
exclusion. They're going to make that

383
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,279
very clear. They're going to go over

384
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,079
with you all of those details and

385
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:48,800
they're going to explain to you all of

386
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,720
the steps. Um, the visit has to include,

387
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,120
you know, that baseline data collection,

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,880
new blood work, are they healthy? All of

389
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,600
these things are going to explain all of

390
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,680
that to you. Are they able to

391
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
participate and get that MRI that's

392
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,680
required? Are they able to get a lumbar

393
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,560
puncture that's required? Well, if your

394
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,880
child has scoliosis and rods, maybe

395
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,639
multiple LPS is going to be a challenge.

396
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,639
So, maybe that's not the best study for

397
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,000
you. Maybe they're thinking a different

398
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
study would be better for you where you

399
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,519
wouldn't have to repeat dose into the

400
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,920
spinal space. So, these are all really,

401
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,279
really important things. They're going

402
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,600
to talk to you about something called an

403
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,480
informed consent form, which is required

404
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,079
to be signed before they can do anything

405
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,560
with your child. They can talk to you

406
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,880
before that, but they can't pull blood.

407
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,360
They can't do an MRI. They can't do any

408
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,160
other assessments until you fi sign this

409
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,399
informed consent. And so, that informed

410
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,199
consent process is a serious serious

411
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,079
process. And all I can say is you have

412
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,800
to read it. I I know. When I talk to the

413
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,880
PIs, a lot of people don't read it and

414
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,800
they just say yes, yes, yes. You have to

415
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,639
pay attention. You have to read it. This

416
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,880
is where you're going to learn as much

417
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,480
as possible about these studies. You're

418
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,800
going to learn the goals, the

419
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,959
procedures, the duration, the

420
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,600
expectations for you as a family, the

421
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,600
expectations for your child, the study

422
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,559
schedule, the duration of time the study

423
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,199
is going to take, the potential risks,

424
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,959
hopefully the potential benefits, and

425
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,720
the right of privacy and withdrawal. So,

426
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,039
if you want to pull your child out, what

427
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,959
what does that look like? The privacy of

428
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,120
your child, all of those things are

429
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,319
going to be in there. You need to ask

430
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,799
questions before signing anything

431
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,880
because sometimes um the informed

432
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,200
consents can be a little bit vague. So

433
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
you want to make sure that you ask the

434
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
questions that you have. That's very

435
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,240
very important. What's the dose? What's

436
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,640
the experience at the site of doing that

437
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,039
procedure? What's the experience in the

438
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,880
field with that technology? What's the

439
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,960
experience in the field for Angelmen

440
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,799
syndrome with that technology? Maybe

441
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,120
even what's the experience in animals

442
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,440
with this technology? Where can I hear

443
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,000
about that information? You have the

444
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,240
right to ask those questions.

445
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
Often you're given this form prior to

446
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,559
the visit where you're asked to read it

447
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,240
and then come to the site ready to sign

448
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,640
it. If you're interested and ask your

449
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,400
questions, read it. Even if you're

450
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,880
reading it in the car, on the plane, I

451
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,280
don't really care. Just read it. You

452
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
have to write questions down. Ask the

453
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,360
questions. when you're in front of the

454
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,880
study doctor, you're nervous. You might

455
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,360
not think about the questions that you

456
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,400
should be asking. So, take some time

457
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,720
beforehand and ask those questions. For

458
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,960
children and adults with as um they're

459
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,039
not able to provide their own consent,

460
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,520
so the parents have to do it for them

461
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,679
and that's very very important. So,

462
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,440
understanding that process is key.

463
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,000
explaining the purpose, the expectation

464
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,480
and the requirements. As I said,

465
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
reviewing carefully

466
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,039
and asking your questions, understanding

467
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,480
the schedule of expectations for you,

468
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
how often do I need to come back to the

469
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,799
hospital? How many EEGs? How many blood

470
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,960
draws? How many MRIs? How many CSF taps?

471
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,200
Those are questions you need to know and

472
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,559
you can't just blip by them. Remember

473
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,880
that participation is voluntary, but you

474
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,799
must commit to satisfy the requirements.

475
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,640
And if you can't, do not enroll in that

476
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,360
study. One, you're taking a spot from

477
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
somebody else. And two, if you know you

478
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,120
can't commit to it, you have to be

479
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,039
honest about that. You can withdraw at

480
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,200
any time and you have to remember that

481
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,280
if you are not comfortable with what is

482
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,200
happening with your child, you can

483
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:33,200
withdraw. The data um may be shared that

484
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,880
you're committing to these trials. The

485
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,880
data that you produce may be shared with

486
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
other vendors. Your CSF fluid might be

487
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
shared with other vendors. It's

488
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
generally deidentified, but you may be

489
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,520
sharing information about your child

490
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,160
with other vendors, and that's all in

491
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,480
the informed consent. So again, read it

492
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,559
carefully. Then your child may be

493
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,760
enrolled in a trial. Once they're

494
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,760
confirmed to meet the inclusion

495
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,440
criteria, you sign the informed consent.

496
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,880
The primary investigator and the parent

497
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,360
agree it's the right thing for that

498
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,200
child. They will enroll. Study

499
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,039
coordinators then will come in and they

500
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
will schedule the visits for you and

501
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,120
provide you with the details of the

502
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,600
instructions of all of the next steps.

503
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,080
Working closely with those coordinators

504
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,039
is absolutely key so that each

505
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,919
participant receives the information

506
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,559
they need. They all get an ID that's

507
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,720
deidentified. So when you see patient

508
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,640
numbers in clinical trials, nobody knows

509
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
who they are. It's very important that

510
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,919
it's essentially anonymous for those

511
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,760
families. Then they're going to get

512
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,000
baseline assessments, measurements,

513
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,640
evaluations, the orca, the bailey, the

514
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,080
vinand, an MRI, a CT. All of these

515
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,480
things are those baseline assessments to

516
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,520
know your starting point. And then over

517
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,520
time, you're going to get um all of

518
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,240
these assessments repeated to see how

519
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,559
things change over time. Some of these

520
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
end points are clinician reported,

521
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,320
meaning you're doing a test and the

522
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,559
clinician is assessing the the patient.

523
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,080
Others are parent reported. So you're

524
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,520
filling out a survey or they're asking

525
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,600
you questions or you're doing an

526
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,240
interview. Clinician reported and parent

527
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,880
reported both have huge value in drug

528
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,000
development. Often a tablet's used to

529
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,760
fill out some of these. So you might

530
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,640
take a tablet home or you might do it at

531
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,679
the site. All things to participate.

532
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,600
Then with study participation,

533
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,120
they get a treatment. Then they get

534
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,720
monitored. Then they have follow-up

535
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,480
visits. You must report any and all side

536
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,880
effects whether they're drugreated or

537
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,559
not drugrelated. Ultimately the doctor

538
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
will determine if the side effects are

539
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,080
drugreated. But you as a parent have the

540
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,320
right to say I'm having a side effect

541
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,600
with my child and this only happens

542
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,200
after my child receives this therapy. I

543
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,559
believe this is drugrelated. You have

544
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
the right to say that. You have the

545
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,600
right to report what you see and you

546
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,600
cannot hide what you see because what

547
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,159
you're going to do is you could cover up

548
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,159
a safety signal that can harm other

549
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,640
patients in the future. It's very

550
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:57,200
important you report everything to your

551
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,840
study doctor. The data is collected both

552
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,760
for efficacy and safety and after active

553
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,559
participation that follow-up period can

554
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,480
vary one year, two years, even three

555
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,200
months and then for gene therapies it

556
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
could be five years or 15 years. What

557
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,159
are you committing to? You have to know

558
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,760
that. You may receive study updates

559
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,600
generally, not necessarily about your

560
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,640
child. You're going to see it in press

561
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,600
releases, in presentations, in um, you

562
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,200
know, in investor calls. Listen to them,

563
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,720
watch them, pay attention to them

564
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,480
because the data of your child is going

565
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,200
to be in there buried with other

566
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,360
children and adults as well. And the

567
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,159
results are often only presented in the

568
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,080
early stages in these public forums. So

569
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,039
key questions to ask, there's lists of

570
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,799
them. What's the goal of this trial?

571
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,400
What are the possible risks and the

572
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,640
possible benefits of enrolling in this

573
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,440
trial? What happened in the animal

574
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,679
studies? What do we need to think about

575
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
for humans? Will my child receive

576
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
treatment? Will they receive a placebo?

577
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,600
Will they receive a sham? Will they

578
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,360
receive a sugar pill? What is my child

579
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,679
going to get? And if they're on that

580
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,840
control, when will they change over to

581
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,919
get treatment, if at all? You have to

582
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,360
know that. How often do I need to come

583
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,120
back to the hospital? Will there be

584
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,200
assessments done locally? Do I need to

585
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,679
come back in? All of the things you need

586
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,200
to be very critical of. Is this a single

587
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,679
treatment therapy? Is it a repeat

588
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,679
treatment therapy? How is that done? Who

589
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,440
do I contact if I have a problem? Get

590
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,799
their phone number. Get their email. You

591
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,559
have to have someone to contact if

592
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
there's a problem. What happens if I

593
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,799
want to withdraw? What's the process of

594
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,880
that? How do I do that? Who pays for

595
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,240
this? Who's paying for the cost? Who's

596
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,760
paying to get to the site? Who's paying

597
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,600
for parking? Who's paying to leave the

598
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,280
site? Who's paying for food? Who's

599
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,200
paying for all of this? You have to ask

600
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,200
these questions. And then once all the

601
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,440
phases are complete, will my child be

602
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,039
able to stay on the drug? If not, when

603
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,200
will my child be able to get the drug

604
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,559
again? All of these things you need to

605
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,280
ask. So make a checklist. Review and

606
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,360
understand your ICF. Ask all of the

607
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,760
questions. Keep copies of all of the

608
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,440
documents. Confirm you know the contact

609
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
person and their number and that you can

610
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,760
always reach out to them with any

611
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,600
questions. Keep a schedule of all of

612
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,840
your appointments. Show up when you're

613
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,400
supposed to show up. Know the days and

614
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,039
the times. Discuss travel and lodging

615
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,919
and reimbursement logistics. And know

616
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,279
your right to withdraw at any time

617
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:21,039
because you have that right. And so

618
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,720
lastly, we'll end with appropriate

619
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,279
etiquette.

620
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,720
Avoid sharing trial details on social

621
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:32,960
media. I cannot emphasize that enough.

622
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,520
Nobody should be talking about their

623
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,000
experience in clinical trials on social

624
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:43,200
media. It creates havoc and expectation

625
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,039
that can destroy a clinical trial. Most

626
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,840
of these trials start off open label and

627
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,919
then people have expectations of what to

628
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,200
expect. You can't do that. You could

629
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,600
talk about it privately with your

630
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,080
friends and family, but you should not

631
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,120
talk about it publicly in a clinical

632
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,840
trial until the data has been shared.

633
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,520
Very important. The same caregiver

634
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,679
should be doing all of the assessments

635
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,679
each time. If it was dad that started,

636
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,200
dad should finish. If it's mom that

637
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,960
started, mom should be there for all of

638
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,279
the assessments. Consistency is

639
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,880
everything. If side effects occur, they

640
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,760
must be immediately shared with your

641
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,000
study doctor. Nothing, like I said,

642
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,720
should be shared on Facebook, Instagram,

643
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,440
Tik Tok, LinkedIn, whatever. Stop doing

644
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,240
it. No private Facebook groups so you

645
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,799
think no one sees it. We all know. Don't

646
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,360
do it. It's just really destructive to

647
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,039
the program. And don't predict what

648
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,360
you're going to see. You set

649
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,240
expectations that might be unrealistic.

650
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,039
Drugs might work. They might not work.

651
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,880
Let it let the data show if the drug is

652
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,240
working. You're allowed to be excited.

653
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
You're allowed to be proud of what you

654
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,520
see, but don't predict to create a sense

655
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,159
of expectations. Try not to. It's really

656
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,679
hard. If you see community members at a

657
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,440
trial site, they may be in different

658
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,760
clinical trials or at a community event.

659
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,520
Try not to talk about it your your trial

660
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,039
experience with them. Try to keep it

661
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,559
private because you're setting

662
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,720
expectations.

663
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,400
Um, and try not to talk to industry

664
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,159
members about your experience in

665
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,279
clinical trials at conferences like

666
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:16,320
this. I know it's hard, but don't go up

667
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,480
to Ionis or Ultragenics or RO or OILL

668
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,200
and say, "My daughter's in your trial

669
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,960
and I'm having this experience." That's

670
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
not who you should be talking to about

671
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,880
that. you should be talking to your

672
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,880
study doctor about that because they are

673
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,279
really meant to be blinded to who's in

674
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,279
the trial and have a line in the sand

675
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,159
from those patients. So, it's not great

676
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,679
to do that. So, try not to try to be a

677
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,679
little bit more vague about things. I

678
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,520
know that's hard as well. And then

679
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,159
finally, respect confidentiality, data

680
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,960
integrity, and your child's privacy.

681
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
Track groups are are discouraged. Be

682
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,720
mindful of community influence on

683
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
outcomes

684
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,080
and any adverse events albeit

685
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,640
drugrelated or non-drugrelated must be

686
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,520
reported to trial sites. They have to be

687
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,440
taken very seriously. Our other

688
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,600
co-atriots of parents and families

689
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,440
deserve to know what the risks are for

690
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,760
their child who are not yet in that

691
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,679
trial. And if you don't report it, they

692
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,559
will not learn from that. It's very,

693
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:21,679
very important. You must make sure your

694
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,559
concerns are heard at every level.

695
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,240
Empower yourself as a family to ask

696
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,000
questions.

697
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,120
Ensure that you do not disclose your

698
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,840
child's participation publicly. Document

699
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,840
your journey. Take videos before of all

700
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,200
the things your child can't do. Take

701
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,000
videos after of all the things your

702
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,159
child can do. And then you have that to

703
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,919
show pre and post. It doesn't mean the

704
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,520
study wants that information, but you

705
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,840
want that information in your own life

706
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,240
as your own diary. I encourage you to do

707
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,880
that. Try and document their skills

708
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,000
leading up to that. Listen to the study

709
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,720
updates and share your experience, good

710
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,880
or bad, with the study doctor. That's

711
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,600
really how you empower yourself to be

712
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,320
part of the journey of drug development.

713
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,120
So with that, remember always knowledge

714
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,919
is power. You can't make decisions on

715
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,320
things you don't understand. So, we have

716
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,480
to all contribute to the research and we

717
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,960
have to all ask questions. So, with

718
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,960
that, thank you.

719
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,760
Okay, so we are due for a break. Um,

720
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,200
that break is going to we're going to

721
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,399
return in about uh 10 minutes. So, it's

722
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,559
going to be a short break. And I want

723
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:36,799
everyone to know people that want more

724
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,600
t-shirts. Apparently, everyone wants

725
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,039
these t-shirts, but they close soon. If

726
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,200
you want more and you already got one, I

727
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
guess they're selling them for $20, but

728
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,320
go outside, go to the t-shirt making

729
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,520
area, tell them what you want, and you

730
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,600
can get more t-shirts. But I think they

731
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,960
close at 12:30. So, anybody that wants

732
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,320
to get more t-shirts, go ahead and get

733
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,919
them because they won't be there after

734
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,840
the final session where we're going to

735
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,840
hear from the ASO programs.
