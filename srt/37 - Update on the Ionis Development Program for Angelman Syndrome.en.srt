1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,960
The next speaker is uh Dr. Candace Jung.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,240
She's coming to us from Ionis

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,839
Pharmaceuticals and she's going to be

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,880
updating us on the development program

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,880
for Angelman Syndrome. Candace.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
Hi everyone. I'm Candace Jung and I'm

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,360
the program lead for ion 582 at Ionis.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
Uh this is my first year at FAST. So I'm

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,960
very grateful to be here to listen and

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
to learn from you and to hear about all

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,879
the exciting advances in Angelmen

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,239
Syndrome research. It's really a great

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,920
time to be part of the community.

14
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,600
So today I'll provide you an update on

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
our program but a couple of just brief

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
disclosures. As I mentioned, I'm an

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,800
employee of Ionis and today I'll prevent

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,840
some I'll present some in information on

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,760
the ION 582 program and ion 582 is an

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,160
investigational medicine. So it's not

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,840
approved by FDA or any regulatory body.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,879
And so today the information I'll show

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,879
is just for educational purposes.

24
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,000
But before I dive in, I first want to

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,840
thank all of you. So thank you to the

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,159
community, the researchers, the

27
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,400
scientists, the clinicians, the families

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
especially. We really appreciate

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,880
everything you've done to make all of

30
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,720
this possible. We wouldn't be here

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,640
without you. So, thank you to all of you

32
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
in the community and the especially the

33
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,400
Halos and the Reveal participants, their

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,759
families, and their caregivers. And of

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
course, all the organizations listed

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,920
here. Again, we couldn't do this without

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,840
you.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
So, some of you may already be familiar

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
with Ionis, but those that aren't, uh,

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
we were founded about 35 years ago, and

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,560
we were focused on developing RNA

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,720
targeted medicines. We really have a

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,960
passion for scientific innovation that

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,680
will help us develop potential medicines

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,640
for challenging illnesses. Um and so we

46
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,079
have about 1100 over 1100 employees now

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,159
some of which have been here the entire

48
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,079
35 years including our CEO

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,479
and we're taking this deep experience

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,159
and expertise in developing RNA targeted

51
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,479
medicines and applying them to

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,680
neurology. And so as you can see here we

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,080
have three approved medicines in

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,720
neurology. So, SpinRazza, Kelsadi and

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,239
Wayua. And we have multiple programs in

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,840
development now. So, all of those you

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
see here listed below are for uh

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
neurological indications and they are

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,920
currently in clinical trials which is

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,920
really really exciting.

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,040
And so throughout the development of ION

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,280
582, collaboration with the community

63
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,360
has been key to advancing our Angelman

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,120
syndrome research. And the common thread

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,720
throughout all of this is listening and

66
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,400
learning from families starting with

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,160
preclinical when we wanted to better

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
understand the illness. So we started

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
research collaborations. We looked to

70
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
understand the natural history and

71
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,480
supported those studies and then going

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
on to early clinical development where

73
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,920
we started participating in consorcia

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,440
continued to participate in the

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,840
conferences and that really helped us

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,599
inform our clinical trial design and now

77
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,760
that we're here in late development that

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,239
collaboration continues with community

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,159
advisor meetings also participating in

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,720
the community advisor boards the global

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,239
angelman syndrome one and again

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,239
throughout all of this listening and

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
learning from you to really inform how

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,400
we design our trials and conduct conduct

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
our trials.

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
We took this same rigorous and

87
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,640
collaborative approach to developing ion

88
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,000
582 and that started with the

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,560
breakthrough of identifying the

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,560
biological target. So Ionis collaborated

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
with a researcher specifically Dr.

92
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,800
Boddet to identify the mechanism to

93
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,840
upregulate UB3A

94
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,360
um using an ASO and from there we

95
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
continued to develop a deep

96
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,040
understanding of the target biology. So

97
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,319
collaborating with doctors and experts

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,560
in Angelman syndrome biology and UB3A to

99
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,040
understand the target. Next came proof

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,239
of concept in disease models where we

101
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,400
continue continued to collaborate with

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,640
researchers Dr. Boddet again to show

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
that an ASO provides benefit in a

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,040
pre-clinical models of Angelman

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,720
syndrome. And then we leveraged our 30

106
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
plus years of experience in developing

107
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,519
RNA targeted medicines to screen

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
candidates and identify ion 582 as our

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
lead candidate for testing and clinical

110
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
trials.

111
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,080
And throughout this, we continue to

112
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,680
develop an deep understanding of the

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,920
syndrome. We're working closely with the

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
community to understand their disease

115
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
and to develop markers to monitor the

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,519
trajectory of the disease that will help

117
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,799
us in clinical trials, which is where we

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,400
are today, evaluating ion 582 in our

119
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,560
phase 3 reveal study.

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,880
So, just a bit more about ion 582 before

121
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,240
I get into uh the program update and

122
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,160
some of the data I'll share with you

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
today. Uh you've already heard a lot

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
about this but just just briefly you

125
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
know on the left you see a cartoon of

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,000
Angelman syndrome neuron and in pink you

127
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,000
have the UB3A gene from mom which is uh

128
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
in Angelmen syndrome as you all know

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,639
loss of the maternal UB3A gene um is

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,880
present so it's either through dilation

131
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,639
or mutation and in all people the

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,759
paternal al is silenced and that's by

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,680
the anti-sense transcript and ion 582 is

134
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,600
designed to specifically target that

135
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,800
anti-sense transcript so that it can be

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,800
unsilenced and it can produce a UB3A

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
protein.

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,560
And so before I get into the the data

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,160
and some updates on our trials, I just

140
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
wanted a couple reminders that Halos,

141
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
that's our phase one two study. It is a

142
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,600
small open label clinical trial. It was

143
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,840
not designed to establish the safety or

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,000
efficacy of ion 582 as a treatment for

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,240
Angelman syndrome. But the result

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
results are overall very encouraging and

147
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
they serve as the basis for our phase

148
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,240
three uh trial which is known as reveal

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
which is ongoing now. and that will

150
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,639
determine the safety and efficacy of ion

151
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,639
582. And so we'll present some initial

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,639
results from halos only today. That's

153
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,800
the phase one two study and some newer

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,160
data from our long long-term extension.

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
So this is a brief overview of our uh uh

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,759
clinical trials that are currently

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
ongoing for ion 582. So on the left you

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,240
have halos which is our phase one two

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,160
global open label study. It was designed

160
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,880
to evaluate the safety and tolerability

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,360
of ion 52 and also some exploratory

162
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,600
measures of clinical efficacy. The trial

163
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,800
includes participants with deletion or

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,960
mutation genotypes and so we have 55

165
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,440
participants in the study aged 2 to 50

166
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,080
years old. The multiple ascending dose

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,720
portion of the study is complete. We

168
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,440
evaluated three doses of ion 5a2. So 20

169
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,759
40 and 80 milligrams and the long-term

170
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
extension is ongoing. So, we have uh the

171
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,080
participants that have completed the MAD

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
are eligible and they'll receive either

173
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,120
40 milligrams or 80 milligrams of ion

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,520
582 for up to an additional four years.

175
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,000
And we're excited to say that we started

176
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,600
uh enrolling in uh participants under

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,919
the age of two this year. So, we amended

178
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,759
the protocol to add that and we dosed

179
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,080
our first under two-year-old participant

180
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,520
in September, which is very exciting.

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,919
Very happy to hear that, too.

182
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,919
And so now I'll move on to reveal. That

183
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,319
is our phase three global placeboc

184
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,080
controlled study and it's designed to

185
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
demonstrate the safety and efficacy of

186
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,639
ion 582 in children and adults with

187
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,560
Angelman syndrome. So this trial also

188
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,599
includes participants with deletion or

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,639
mutation genotypes and they are also

190
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,319
aged 2 to 50 years old. Our primary

191
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,120
objective for the study is to evaluate

192
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,280
if ion 582 helps participants improve

193
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,840
expressive communication. So that's use

194
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,080
the use of sounds, gestures and and ways

195
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,680
to communicate using the Bailey 4

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,599
assessment.

197
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
We dosed our first participant in June

198
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,080
which is very exciting and the study is

199
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,240
now approved in the US, Canada, UK,

200
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919
Japan, South Korea, Singapore and

201
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,759
Australia.

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,440
At the time of finalizing these slides

203
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,759
we which was about a week ago we had

204
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,039
nine sites activated in the US and now

205
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm excited to say that we have an

206
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,840
additional four sites activated. one in

207
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
the US, one in the UK, one in Canada,

208
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,120
and one in Australia. So things are

209
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,199
moving along really nicely and we're

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,599
excited to now have some global sites

211
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
involved and we'll continue to open more

212
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,319
sites as the throughout the end of the

213
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,319
year and globally.

214
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,120
So I'll give you a brief update on our

215
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,599
Halos phase one two study like where we

216
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,919
are today with it. And so, as I

217
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,919
mentioned, the participants in ages 2 to

218
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,280
55, they we've completed enrollment

219
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,599
there. They've completed the MAD

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,360
portion. 98% transitioned over to the

221
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,759
long-term extension where all

222
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,840
participants are receiving ion 582 every

223
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,080
12 weeks. And the long-term extension

224
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,599
will last for about four years. And on

225
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,840
average, participants have now received

226
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,159
ION 582 for about two years and for some

227
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,080
up to three years. So, now we're able to

228
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,560
get that long-term data to characterize

229
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,159
ION 582.

230
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
And as I noted, we have started

231
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,080
enrolling participants under the age of

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
two. So that those cohorts are open for

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
enrollment. Participants that are

234
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,440
included in the study will have either a

235
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,600
deletion or mutation of UB3A.

236
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,279
And all will receive it. It is open

237
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,920
label. So all participants will receive

238
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,000
ion 582 every 12 weeks. And they'll

239
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,839
receive it for about approximately four

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,240
years. And there'll be about up to 15

241
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,600
participants in this age group. As I

242
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
mentioned, we do our first part

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,680
participant in September. and we

244
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,959
currently are enrolling at sites in the

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,959
US, EU, and Israel.

246
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,320
So, I'd like to share a little data on

247
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,320
the Bailey for expressive communication

248
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,920
from our Halo study, but before I do

249
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,839
that, I just wanted to briefly uh talk

250
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,000
about the Bailey, and I know you've all

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,519
heard a bit about it. This uh over the

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,440
past few days, there's been some great

253
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,000
presentations on it, but so just

254
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,760
briefly, the Bailey forum measures a few

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,920
different domains. It looks at language

256
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
and communication through expressive

257
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
communication and receptive

258
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,040
communication. It also looks at

259
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,120
cognitive function, so learning, memory,

260
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,600
and concept formation. And it also

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,760
assesses motor function, so fine motor,

262
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
so reaching, object manipulation, and

263
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,880
grasping. And also gross motor, so

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
locomotion and coordination and balance.

265
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
So I'll talk a little bit more about

266
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,680
expressive communication because I'll

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,920
show you some data on that.

268
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
And so what does it evaluate? It

269
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,839
evaluates how your child communicates

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
with others through sounds, gestures,

271
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,680
words, and other ways of expressing

272
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,279
themselves. Uh the assessment is

273
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,640
performed in the clinic and the

274
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,160
clinician will talk or play with your

275
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,920
child to see how how they respond. And

276
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
they'll observe how your child uses

277
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,320
gestures or vocalizations to get

278
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,839
attention or show interest. And it'll

279
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
look for signs that your child

280
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,040
understands how communication works,

281
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,040
even if spoken words aren't used yet.

282
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,720
And so this is our uh our data from the

283
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,959
long-term extension portion of our study

284
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,160
from our Halos phase one two study. And

285
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,399
this is looking at expressive

286
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,720
communication on the Bailey 4. And what

287
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,640
we're seeing is continued improvement in

288
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480
expressive communication through 18

289
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,640
months across all ages and all

290
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,880
genotypes. So what the chart is showing

291
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
you is uh participants that have been

292
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:52,079
treated with ion 582 and that's the pink

293
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,240
line. And then it's also showing

294
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,160
patients that have partic participated

295
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,519
in a natural history study. So this is

296
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,680
the what you would expect that sort of

297
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,160
the typical uh developing trajectory for

298
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,480
expressive communication in individuals

299
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,959
living with Angelman syndrome. On the

300
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,040
y-axis you're seeing u the change the

301
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,600
mean change from baseline in expressive

302
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,760
communication on the GSV score. That's

303
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,600
the growth scale value. And that's a

304
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,760
score that allows clinicians to look at

305
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,760
how your child is is developing over

306
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,360
over time. how their their communication

307
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,600
skills are changing over time in this

308
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,760
case. And what we see are improvements

309
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
on the Bailey for measure of expressive

310
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,519
communication at both 40 milligrams and

311
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,959
80 milligrams. So those doses are pulled

312
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
here in that pink line. All these

313
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,040
individual participants received either

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,360
40 or 80 that exceed the natural

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,000
history. So that's very encouraging and

316
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,920
um great support for continuing our our

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
exploration in our phase three study.

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,680
I'll also show you some EEG data that

319
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,920
was presented earlier this week at the

320
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,399
Abomb uh translational research meeting

321
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,399
by my colleague Yonis Papus. But first,

322
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,480
I'll get into just a little bit on what

323
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
an EEG is. I again you've heard about

324
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,760
this this weekend too and a lot of you

325
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,920
probably are probably already familiar

326
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,839
with it. But it's a non-invasive

327
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,000
procedure where 20 electrodes with small

328
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,440
metal discs are secured to the scalp

329
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,680
while the individual is awake and

330
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,240
there's no medical no medical risks

331
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,720
associated with the procedure.

332
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,720
It detects electrical activity from the

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,399
brain. So the brain cells produce small

334
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,639
electrical charges and those can be

335
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,639
detected at the level of the scalp and

336
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,519
they so they produce waves of electrical

337
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,120
activity as you can see there

338
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,680
and it's used to evaluate brain

339
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,360
function. So, EEG data that was

340
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,600
collected in the Halos phase one two

341
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,600
study provides more information about

342
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,760
brain wave patterns in the individuals

343
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,000
with Angelman syndrome in the study

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,240
and research has shown that EEGs are

345
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,600
abnormal in Angelmen syndrome. So, on on

346
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,519
the left you see what you would

347
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
typically see in a neurotypical

348
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,680
individual uh on an EEG when they're

349
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,399
awake and then on the right is what you

350
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,000
see uh from an Angelman syndrome uh

351
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,839
participant. Oops, sorry.

352
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
And so you see more activity in this

353
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,000
case you're seeing more activity um and

354
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,000
delta waves or delta activity is also

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,760
called delta power and so and delta

356
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,240
power has been shown to correlate with

357
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
cognitive function in angelman syndrome

358
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
it so therefore it may serve as a

359
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
biioarker for treatment response in

360
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
clinical trials

361
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,680
and what we're seeing is that ion 582

362
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,440
demonstrates delta suppression at 40 and

363
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,040
80 milligrams levels and so the chart on

364
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
the left what that's showing you is the

365
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,639
green line is the 20 milligram dose. So

366
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,399
this is during the multiple sending dose

367
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
portion, the first part of our study,

368
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,240
the first six months. And then in blue,

369
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,399
you're seeing participants that were

370
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,639
treated with either 40 or 80 milligrams.

371
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,120
And on the y-axis, you have the EEG

372
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,320
delta power change from baseline. And

373
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,399
then you have time on the x-axis. And

374
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,240
what we're seeing is really the key

375
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,160
takeaways are that we're seeing robust

376
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,200
delta power suppression. So lowering of

377
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,880
that delta activity at month six. And

378
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,600
we're seeing similar reductions for both

379
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,600
the 40 and the 80 milligram groups. Um

380
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
but we don't see any effect at the 20

381
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
milligram which uh that we did not take

382
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,199
that dose forward into our long-term

383
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,199
extension.

384
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,440
So in conclusion from with where we are

385
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,519
today with halos uh so participants have

386
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
received on average two years of

387
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,360
treatment with ion 582 and up to three.

388
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,079
So, we're getting that nice long-term

389
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,199
data to be able to characterize ion 582

390
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,199
safety and potential efficacy.

391
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,880
We're seeing a similar reduction in EEG

392
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,600
delta power at 40 milligrams and 80

393
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,279
milligrams of ion 582. And the

394
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,360
expressive communication data indicate

395
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,279
improvement through 18 months in both

396
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,160
children and adults receiving 40

397
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,560
milligrams or 80 milligrams of ion 582.

398
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,760
And we plan to publish our halos

399
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,760
18-month data next year.

400
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,199
So now I'll move on to reveal which is

401
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,360
our global phase three trial for

402
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,880
children and adults with Angelman

403
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
syndrome.

404
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,600
So trial participants uh will be

405
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,920
included if they have a mutation or a

406
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,760
deletion of UB3A

407
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,160
and it will include similar to the halo

408
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
study children and adults ages 2 to 50.

409
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,639
It is a double blind placeboc controlled

410
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,120
study and participants will receive a

411
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,639
dose every three months.

412
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,079
And our trial objectives are here and

413
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,920
the and the primary objective is to

414
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
evaluate the effect of ion 52 on

415
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
expressive communication through using

416
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
the Bailey 4. And importantly, we've

417
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
included other objectives as well

418
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,800
because we want to look at the totality

419
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,760
of the evidence to fully characterize

420
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,040
how ion 582 may improve the lives of

421
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,639
individuals living with Angelman

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,399
syndrome and their families. So we're

423
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
also looking at cognition, so learning

424
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,800
and memory. uh receptive communication,

425
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,480
that's the ability to understand others,

426
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,279
overall disease severity, sleep

427
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,440
problems, motor function, as well as

428
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,680
daily daily living skills. And so the

429
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,000
study team and the investigator at the

430
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,120
site will closely monitor safety, but we

431
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,199
also do have an independent uh board of

432
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,399
physicians that will monitor safety as

433
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,480
well. The trial is currently enrolling.

434
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,320
It is a global study and as I mentioned

435
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,240
a week ago, we had nine sites in the US.

436
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,279
Now we have 10 also with one in

437
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,600
Australia, the UK and Canada. And so

438
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,839
we'll continue to activate activate

439
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,120
sites around the world and as they get

440
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,279
are getting close to activation or

441
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,600
activated, we will post those sites on

442
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,480
clinical trials.gov so you can see if

443
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
there's a trial site near you. The trial

444
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
will last about three and a half years.

445
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,160
So there are two parts of the trial. The

446
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,240
first part is the double blind placeboc

447
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,399
controlled treatment period. And so

448
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,480
participants will receive ion 582 or

449
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,320
placebo. And then there's a two-year

450
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,120
long-term extension where everyone

451
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,120
receives ION 582.

452
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,320
And you know, the feedback that we've

453
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,079
received from you, from the community,

454
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,279
from the families, that's really what's

455
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,040
guided us and how we've selected

456
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,480
endpoints in our clinical trial. And I

457
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,440
think this is really well demonstrated

458
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,480
by the ASF survey from the Angelman

459
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,040
Syndrome uh externally led PFDD meeting

460
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,959
in in April. And there the top three

461
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,680
symptom domains having the most impact

462
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,279
on individuals was surveyed. And what

463
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,680
came out is that communication really

464
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,039
matters to families and living with

465
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,480
Angelmen syndrome. And so that is our

466
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,000
primary we've chosen expressive

467
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,000
communication as our primary endpoint.

468
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,600
But again importantly we have several

469
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,199
secondary endpoints that are assessing

470
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,880
many of these symptom domains here

471
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,640
because we really recognize that it is

472
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,439
the totality of the evidence. We want to

473
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
understand how ion 582 may help

474
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,120
individuals living with Angelmen

475
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
syndrome across multiple domains so that

476
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,319
we can hopefully provide a treatment

477
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,640
that really improves their lives and the

478
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,640
lives of families.

479
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,600
So what will participation in reveal

480
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,200
look like? It starts with the screening

481
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,440
period. Um so you heard a little bit

482
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,520
about this earlier and uh where the

483
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,559
eligibility criteria will be assessed

484
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,480
and then if the participant is eligible

485
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,559
then they'll move into the double blind

486
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
treatment control double blind placebo

487
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
control treatment period and so during

488
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,120
this time there will be nine in-person

489
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,120
clinic visits uh during screening and

490
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,320
the double blind treatment period and

491
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,840
five doses of ion 582 or placebo and the

492
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,200
little checklists you see there are when

493
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,480
the assessments will be performed. So

494
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,960
they're performed about every six

495
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,120
months. From there, participants will

496
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,440
seamlessly transition to the long-term

497
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,000
extension where all participants will

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
receive ion 582 for another four years.

499
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
And this is followed by a follow-up

500
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,280
period of about eight months. So during

501
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,679
the long-term extension and the

502
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,000
follow-up period, there are 14 in-person

503
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:28,600
clinic visits and participants will

504
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,600
receive nine doses of ion 582.

505
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,679
And we're very excited today today that

506
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,200
we can announce that we'll be starting a

507
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,679
phase three study in individuals with

508
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
Angelmen syndrome and genetic diagnosis

509
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,799
of uniparental dyme or imprinting

510
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,200
defect. So UPD or ID and we're planning

511
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,880
to start that study next year. So very

512
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,280
excited

513
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,600
and uh this this will be known as the

514
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,480
champion study and we'll plan to include

515
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,080
children and adults with UPD or ID and

516
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,919
again we're planning to start the study

517
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,840
next year. So very happy to share that

518
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,400
today.

519
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,640
So in summary, uh our reveal, our

520
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,720
pivotal phase three study is ongoing. It

521
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,280
is on track to complete enrollment next

522
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,440
year. So very excited about that. Our

523
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
open label halos phase one two study is

524
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,240
also ongoing. So we're continuing to

525
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,760
generate that long-term data. And also

526
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,679
we're currently enrolling participants

527
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,559
under the age of two as well. And that's

528
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,840
at sites in the US, EU, and Israel. And

529
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,559
as I just mentioned, we're initiating

530
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,559
the UPD ID study next year. And we're

531
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,880
advancing this study with input from

532
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,960
fast ASF, the hope and action survey and

533
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,120
and also a caregiver advisory board so

534
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,880
we can get your input into how we design

535
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,120
and conduct our trial because it's very

536
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,240
important to us. So thank you again for

537
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,240
the opportunity to be here today.

538
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,679
Yay. You heard us loud and clear. So

539
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,720
this is why these meetings matter

540
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,720
because the sponsors hear your voice and

541
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
we all have been saying for years that

542
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,919
we need to include all genotypes and

543
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,559
here we are. So this is very very

544
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,559
exciting for our community.
