1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,960
With that, our next speaker is Dr.

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,640
Nadavatu, who's gonna perfectly

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,800
complement what was just talked about,

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,280
which is how do we think about the genes

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
outside of UB3A. And so, he's going to

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,240
talk to us about a new technology. I

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,679
think you heard from him last year and

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
the year before, but we've made some

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,279
really nice progress in the last year

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,279
about upregulating the genes that are

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,000
important outside of EB3A. So, please

12
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,000
come and present.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,640
Thanks.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,680
>> Thank you so much and for the

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,680
introduction. And so let me see if it

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,680
starts.

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,440
>> Oh, cool. All right. So, we'll start

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,960
with disclosure and move to gene

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,120
regulatory elements. So, um my lab works

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,680
on gene regulatory elements and what

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
we've been using them for here is in

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
terms of therapy. So, just a quick 101

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
on gene regulatory elements. So

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,800
everybody's on board. If you have a

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
gene, you probably have a promoter which

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600
serve an onoff switch right next to the

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,159
gene that turns on if we envision it as

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,159
like a light bulb. But in addition, you

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,320
have what's called dimmer switches that

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,520
could be very far away that are called

31
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,759
enhancers that sort of turn on the other

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,680
switch at different time points in

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,400
different locations. And they can

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
control the levels of the gene that's

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
being expressed, which is very important

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
here.

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,840
So um going back to

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,320
why I've told you about this. Well, we

39
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
started a work in the lab over 12 years

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,479
ago on trying to take advantage of these

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,079
switches for diseases where you have low

42
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
dosage. So if you have a gene that's

43
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,280
expressed at a lower dose, can we sort

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,520
of pump up the volume of a switch to fix

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
those diseases? And we started on these

46
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,920
types of diseases called Haplo

47
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,479
insufficient. HLO is half insufficient

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,200
is not enough. And so we have basically

49
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,040
two copies of a gene, one from mom, one

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,159
from dad. That leads to normal gene

51
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,280
levels. And if we have one copy that's a

52
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,440
loss of function, that leads to 50% and

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
that could lead to disease. And there's

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,920
actually 660 genes that lead to human

55
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,120
disease due to having just one copy and

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
a lot of severe epilepsies, cancer, and

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,520
many others. And the numbers could be

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
much higher. If you look at a lot of

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,160
genome sequencing that has been done in

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,319
humans, you see 3,000 genes where you

61
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,760
never see this. Basically, one gene

62
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,400
non-functional and one that's

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,160
functional. So, I'm assuming everybody's

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,640
heard about crisper that can come and

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,560
cut the DNA and change it. But here,

66
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,120
we've been using a different form of

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,519
crisper where there's two mutations in

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,560
crisper. And so, it can't work as a

69
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,440
scissors. It can't cut the DNA. But what

70
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,160
you can use it is a delivery truck to

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,800
bring things to a specific zip code in

72
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,640
the genome to a specific location. And

73
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,640
for example, you can bring it to these

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,239
promoters that I just told you, these

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,800
switches, and you can tag along with it

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,760
for the ride an activator, something

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,800
that will sort of pump up the volume of

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,480
that switch and just force it to make

79
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,920
more RNA, more protein. And that's been

80
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,640
called crisper A for crisper activation.

81
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,040
So going back to this model, you still

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,080
have one copy that's perfectly fine.

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,879
It's just not it's just giving you 50%.

84
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,560
So what if we target it with crisper A

85
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,720
and force it to make more RNA? Can we

86
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,599
fix those diseases with just one

87
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,080
functional copy? And so that worked very

88
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,080
nicely. We did it initially on obesity.

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,879
And you can see here on the left a mouse

90
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,599
that has one copy of a gene called sim 1

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,840
that leads it to be very very obese. And

92
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,480
in the middle you see a mouse that has

93
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,959
exactly the same genotype. So it should

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,799
be very obese but you can see that it

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
looks like a wild type mice suggesting

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,000
that this could work and not only on

97
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,840
this but on many other diseases. So over

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
the years we've been working on a few

99
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,400
other diseases. One of them recently was

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,360
published in nature three weeks ago

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,560
where we went after SCN2A which is the

102
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,479
top neuro one of the top

103
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,959
neurodedevelopmental genes in humans. We

104
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,359
did a very similar approach and we

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,560
managed to rescue action potential. We

106
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,880
also managed to rescue a neuronal age

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,360
and maturity even in more adult mice

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
suggesting that here also similar to

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,919
Angelmen there could be a chance of

110
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,600
rescuing at a later stage. And we've

111
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,919
also rescued seizures. So you can see

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,960
here on the top in black is a wild type

113
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,840
mice. In blue you can see a mouse that's

114
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,120
has one copy and has seizures and then

115
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,240
all the way below you can see the

116
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,000
crisper for that where we rescue those

117
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,479
seizures using this approach.

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,240
So, and in addition, we also did this in

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,080
human cells in a dish where we

120
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,440
differentiate them to neurons just like

121
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,280
young wei showed before and we put them

122
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,600
in a dish for two months, grow them as

123
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,000
neurons and you could see on the left

124
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,080
the wild type in the middle of the heads

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,600
and on the right we managed to rescue

126
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,440
their action potential in the dish. So,

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,479
what does that all have to do with

128
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,000
Angelmen? Well, going back here with the

129
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,600
beautiful work that's being done here

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,160
for UB3A and hopefully that'll be fixed.

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
There'll still be a problem for many of

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,600
the patients that are missing and have

133
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,400
this micro deletion and missing 16 genes

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,880
which amongst them we think some of them

135
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,039
could be haplo insufficient and these in

136
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,600
red are the five that we think might be

137
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,960
problematic. Similar to the one gene

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
that I've showed you where you have just

139
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,960
one copy, that's not enough. Here we

140
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,160
have five. That's not enough. And so

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,440
what we could do, similar to before, is

142
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,639
upregulate not just one gene, but try to

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,560
upregulate basically all five at once.

144
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:05,039
And if we could do that, that could be

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,080
very beneficial for these individuals.

146
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,720
And so we went through all five genes

147
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,319
and basically designed guides where

148
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,240
we're transfecting and trying to

149
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
optimize these conditions for them. And

150
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,919
then we turn to a deno associated virus

151
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,120
which is used as a a delivery tool in

152
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,759
clinical studies and then made a a

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,520
vector that has all five genes. As you

154
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,680
can see this actually worked very

155
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,759
nicely. You can see all five genes and

156
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,520
all five of them we managed to

157
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,199
upregulate very nicely in these cells.

158
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
And so now what we're doing is we're

159
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,319
working with Young Way's lab to give him

160
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,720
these AAVs. And we're in the process now

161
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,160
of actually sending them to test in the

162
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,360
cell lines that he just showed you

163
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,240
before to see can we upregulate all five

164
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
genes and can that lead to a therapeutic

165
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,319
benefit.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,880
In addition, we're also doing this in

167
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,440
mice and we're almost there. We have one

168
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,280
last gene, GABA G3, that's been very

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,440
problematic. It's hardly expressed in

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,000
any cell type that we've tried, but

171
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,720
we're trying now in mice to see can we

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,720
optimize it there. And once we do that,

173
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
we'll go to yet I think another mouse

174
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,759
model that wasn't mentioned where there

175
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,039
is the deletion but UB3A is rescued in

176
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,479
that and see can we rescue all of that

177
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,080
in these mice again with young ways lab.

178
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,759
So that's where we are at the moment and

179
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,280
I hope that next year we'll finally have

180
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,199
phenotypic results for this. Finally, I

181
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
want to thank my amazing lab who's doing

182
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,840
this, her amazing collaboration with

183
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,680
Young Ways Lab and also Allison in

184
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,840
particular who really jumpst started

185
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,319
this project and put us all together and

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,960
without her none of this would have been

187
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,160
done and I should mention that if this

188
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,319
works there are 200 syndromes in humans

189
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,919
that are caused by micro deletions and

190
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,160
so this will not only be amazing for

191
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,440
Angelmen but amazing for another 200

192
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,440
diseases. So thank you Alison.

193
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,759
That was great and and very well

194
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,280
understood. And so, as you can see,

195
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,039
we're we're moving there, but it's a

196
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
process and it takes time. Um, but we're

197
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,759
getting there. And hopefully next year

198
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
we can share with you our approach and

199
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,039
how we think about translating that into

200
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,240
humans and how we can actually

201
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,240
upregulate some of these genes.
