1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
So our next speaker um is Emma Brashard.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,839
She's coming to us from Boston

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,520
Children's Hospital. And she's going to

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,519
talk to us about something also really

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,840
important that just gets lost in

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,360
Angelmen Syndrome. And as having a child

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,320
who lives with cortical visual

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,560
impairment or CVI, CVI is really

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,520
important. It really can impact

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,519
functioning and living and safety on

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,720
many levels and all of their abilities

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,039
over time. And so what we um really need

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,079
to do is understand the prevalence and

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,920
the significance of CGI of of CVI in the

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,360
Angelmen syndrome community. And she's

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,040
going to talk to us about her learnings

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
there. And we also have a vision

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,480
therapist right outside if anyone wants

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,399
to go and talk about their child because

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
so many kids with Angelmen live with CVI

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,399
and they're just totally underdiagnosed

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,239
and it can change their life once they

23
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,879
get vision therapy. So I'm very excited

24
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,879
to hear this talk.

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
Hi everyone, my name is Emma. I am a

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,280
research assistant with the Angelman

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
Syndrome Clinical Research Group at

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
Boston Children's Hospital. And today

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,520
I'll be sharing my research project on

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,080
cerebral visual impairment or CVI in

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,080
Angelman Syndrome.

32
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,680
Okay, to give a brief overview, CVI is a

33
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,159
neurological condition that affects the

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,640
brain's visual processing pathways. This

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,799
results in vision difficulties

36
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,720
um that cannot be explained solely by

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,680
ocular abnormalities or problems with

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,280
the eyes. Individuals with CVI often

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
have difficulty with visual attention

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,280
and recognition, making it harder to

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,159
process and interpret visual

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,920
information. And CVI is often considered

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,880
the leading cause of childhood blindness

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,880
and low vision.

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,799
Perkins School for the Blind, a

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
Massachusetts institution that is

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
supports individuals with visual

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,000
impairments, estimates that one in 30

49
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,159
school age children have CVI related

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,240
vision difficulties.

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,679
Of these children, 72% have

52
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,160
developmental delays, 64% have epilepsy,

53
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,239
and 20% have genetic anomalies, all

54
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
features commonly seen in Angelman

55
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,400
syndrome.

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,480
CVI often co- occurs with other visual

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,800
conditions such as stbismas and

58
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,959
refractive errors including myopia

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,440
hyperopia and a stigmatism

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,239
and fewer than 20% of individuals with

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,599
CVI receive a formal diagnosis making it

62
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,120
a highly underdiagnosed condition. A CVI

63
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
diagnosis is typically made by an

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,000
opthalmologist or optometrist who has

65
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,120
specific knowledge of CVI through a

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,040
combination of a visual evaluation, um,

67
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,360
direct observation of a child's

68
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,120
behaviors, and caregiver input.

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,920
Many individuals with CBI have

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,879
difficulties with navigating indoor and

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,000
outdoor spaces, recognizing objects,

72
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,720
images, and people, visually tracking a

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,440
moving object or person, looking and

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,200
finding something in visual clutter,

75
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,720
using vision in combination with other

76
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,560
senses

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,959
and light sensitivity or needing more

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,040
light.

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,640
Um based on responses from caregivers in

80
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,840
this study, um they shared examples of

81
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,080
experiences that their um children with

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,800
Angelman syndrome might have that are

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,280
related to CVI, including that their

84
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,680
child has difficulty distinguishing

85
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,440
familiar from unfamiliar faces and might

86
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,440
need to use other features of a person

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
like their voice or clothing in order to

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
recognize them.

89
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,200
hesitates when transitioning between

90
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,280
different surfaces like from a wood

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,120
floor um to a carpet floor.

92
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,879
Trips or falls over clearly visible

93
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,400
objects while walking. Not due to

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,239
mobility challenges but more due to the

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
fact that they can't see the objects

96
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
that are in front of them.

97
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,879
Struggling to walk down steps or on

98
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,319
uneven surfaces.

99
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,599
Showing a preference for touching

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
objects rather than looking at them.

101
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,159
They might reach out for an object while

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,080
they're looking the opposite direction.

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,560
um having a delayed response or not

104
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,519
noticing movement like not noticing when

105
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,040
a person walks by um or a car when a car

106
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,120
goes past them or a ball goes past them.

107
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
Shows distress or anxiety in new and

108
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
unfamiliar environments

109
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,479
and attending only to objects directly

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,880
in front of them and not noticing things

111
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:33,520
in their peripheral um or below eye

112
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,759
level leading to a reduced visual field.

113
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
Um we decided to design a study to

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,680
further explore CVI and Angelman

115
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,440
syndrome.

116
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,880
We hypothesize that individuals with

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639
endammen syndrome have an increased risk

118
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,440
for CVI as compared to the general

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,880
population.

120
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
And the goal of this study is to

121
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,160
determine the proportion of individuals

122
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,040
who screen positive for CVI using a

123
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,040
standardized screening questionnaire.

124
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,400
In this study, the primary caregiver

125
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
completes a one-time virtual visit with

126
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,680
a research coordinator, which includes a

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,320
visual health questionnaire that asks

128
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,919
about the participants visual concerns,

129
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
previous vision evaluations, and current

130
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,160
therapies. Caregivers are also asked

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,479
whether the participant has been

132
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,880
previously evaluated for CVI and has a

133
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,880
CVI diagnosis.

134
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,320
and the teach CVI screening tool um

135
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
which includes questions related to

136
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
visual attention, recognition,

137
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,320
perception of movement and visual motor

138
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,759
coordination.

139
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
Different version of the screening tool

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,440
are used for ambulatory and

141
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
non-ambulatory individuals so that

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,320
mobility related questions are not asked

143
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,800
when not relevant and the ambulatory

144
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,320
version of 35 questions and the

145
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,759
non-ambulatory version has 19 questions.

146
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,360
Um, participants are classified as

147
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,400
having a positive or negative screen

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,400
based on the scoring al algorithm and a

149
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,360
positive screen suggests possible signs

150
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,440
of CVI but does not confirm a diagnosis.

151
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,759
In clinical practice, a teach CVI might

152
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,600
be used by a clinician um as a

153
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,600
structured history tool to support the

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,600
evaluation and diagnosis of CBI.

155
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,080
So far, we have 20 participants who have

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,160
completed the study. The group includes

157
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,360
a relatively equivalent number of males

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,840
and females. The um the age ranges from

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:31,680
2 to 48 years old with 70% under the age

160
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:33,280
of 18 and 75% were deletion and 25% had

161
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,680
mutation subtype. We do not yet have

162
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,319
individuals with upt or imprinting

163
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,440
defect but we hope to enroll these

164
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:44,160
molecular subtypes as a study continues.

165
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,560
And according to caregiver report, 55%

166
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,800
of participants walked independently and

167
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,120
5% walked with support as their primary

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
means of getting around. These

169
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,840
individuals were considered ambulatory

170
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
for this study. And the remaining 40%

171
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
were non-ambulatory, meaning they

172
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,720
primarily used a stroller or wheelchair

173
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:07,440
or crawled or scooted um to get around.

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,400
Okay, here are the very preliminary

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,240
screening results for our study. We had

176
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:16,080
eight participants screen positive for

177
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,800
CVI and 12 screen negative. Of those who

178
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,440
screened positive, three were already

179
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,319
had a formal CVI diagnosis while five

180
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,319
had not yet been evaluated for CVI by a

181
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,479
vision specialist. And of those who

182
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,960
screened negative, two already had a

183
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,880
formal CVI diagnosis and the other 10

184
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,199
had not yet been evaluated for CVI.

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,880
Here's

186
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,800
a further breakdown of the screening

187
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,280
results by the different demographic

188
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,039
groups. Um, at this early stage in the

189
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,720
study, we didn't notice any significant

190
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,360
differences among the demographic

191
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,000
groups. Um, but we will continue to

192
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,000
observe these trends as the study sample

193
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
grows.

194
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,440
And we are still looking to recruit more

195
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
participants. So, if you are a caregiver

196
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,879
of an individual with Angelman syndrome

197
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,800
and you're interested in participating,

198
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,000
you can scan the QR code or go to the

199
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,240
link redcap.linkdvi

200
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,080
um to fill out an interest form and feel

201
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
free to reach out directly to me via my

202
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,639
email if you have any questions. We're

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
enrolling participants of all ages and

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,639
subtypes. And we're especially

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,479
interested in enrolling participants who

206
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,479
have already been formally evaluated for

207
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,479
CBI.

208
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,360
And I'd like to acknowledge our

209
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
collaborators at the New England College

210
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
of Optometry and the Perkins School for

211
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,880
the Blind. Um, as well as the rest of

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,880
the Angelman Syndrome Research Group at

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,159
Boston Children's. And of course, a big

214
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,159
thank you to all the families who

215
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,159
participated.

216
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,669
[Applause]

217
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,120
What a great job. We can't underestimate

218
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,560
the value of that information and

219
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,240
hopefully more people participate

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,600
because I do think once we see this is a

221
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
real significant problem in the

222
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,399
community, I think we're going to be

223
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
able to address it in a much bigger way

224
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,920
and really get vision therapy on the

225
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,600
IEPs for these kids because I do think

226
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
it changes everything for them. And

227
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,279
certainly when Quincy was diagnosed, it

228
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
changed a whole heck of a lot. Her whole

229
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,760
AC device is different because of her

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,279
diagnosis of CVI and how we think about

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,279
contrast as it relates to CVI.
