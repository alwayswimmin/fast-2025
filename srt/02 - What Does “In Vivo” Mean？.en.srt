1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
So with that, our next speaker is Dr.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,560
Ronnie Samakco, who's going to be

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,280
talking to us about what does invivo

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,559
mean and how do these models matter in

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,559
Angelmen syndrome. Ronnie.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,880
So, first I'd like to thank by uh start

7
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,279
by thanking Allison for the invitation

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,840
to join you all today and thank you to

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,000
all the families, parents, caregivers,

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,320
and researchers, all the stakeholder

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,040
communities that are here joining us for

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,800
this fantastic event. So my name is

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,879
Rodney Samco and I'm going to be talking

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,280
about why does invivo or what does

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
invivo mean and why do models matter in

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,399
as

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,399
so [clears throat] this is my disclosure

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,520
statement.

19
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,320
So a little bit about how I got here. I

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
think many of you um may be familiar

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
with some of the people in these

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,119
pictures. So I have met some of you.

23
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,960
I've been to the fast event. I think the

24
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,600
last time was 2018 or 2019. Um, and that

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,200
was when I was a former academic at

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
Baylor College of Medicine in Texas

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,640
Children's Hospital. But it really has

28
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,479
been quite a journey. And the reason I'm

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,360
telling you this kind of long-winded

30
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,400
history is for the purpose of today,

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,360
right? You made the choice. You made the

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,439
choice to come here, take the flight

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,920
that may or may not be cancelled later

34
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,079
today. [laughter]

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
um and deal with what may be going on

36
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,560
all around you, whether that be personal

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,360
or professional. But the reason you are

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,759
here today is to shape that perspective

39
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,920
of empowerment, empowerment of knowledge

40
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,360
and knowing that once you have that

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,600
knowledge, you could understand what's

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
happening in the Angelmen community and

43
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,920
all the efforts that are going towards

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,880
and I say efforts. So what I mean by

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,920
that is whether it be people, personnel,

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,159
capacity, finances, resources, etc. all

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,640
those efforts that are going towards

48
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,200
finding actionable therapies for

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
Angelmen syndrome. And so I started off

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,680
as an undergrad at UC Davis. I know

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,080
there are many researchers that we are

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,480
indebted to for developing some of the

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
work that's ongoing at UC Davis. I

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
worked with Janine Lasowl and she

55
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,800
trained with someone you may know, Mark

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,280
Lant, who was one of the co-discoverers

57
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
of the mutations in UB3A that cause

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,319
Angelman syndrome alongside Art Bodat.

59
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,640
And in 1999, I was a um very excited

60
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,680
undergrad to join Baylor College of

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,160
Medicine as a summer intern working with

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,239
young and art. And that was an exciting

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,040
time for me as you could see young ways

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,120
there in that picture. Moving forward, I

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,720
had a lab as I said a former academic

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,879
Baylor College of College of Medicine

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,280
and Texas Children's Hospital. and was

68
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,440
quite exciting to basically focus on

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,120
pre-clinical models of rare

70
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,480
neurodedevelopmental conditions and

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,599
epilepsy disorders. And so my expertise

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,959
is in modeling animals models modeling

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,879
animals mice and rats.

74
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,159
>> No, it's still to the right. It's good.

75
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,239
>> Oh,

76
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,080
>> it's there.

77
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,159
>> Oh, okay.

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,280
>> Hi, everyone. [laughter]

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,760
Thank you, Allison. Um yeah, so I was

80
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,080
saying to the far right, that's uh my

81
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,800
lab there. Um but leveraging rodent

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,519
models to study um the preclinical

83
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,360
measures that we could use as readouts

84
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,000
when we're testing specific therapies,

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,959
whether they be ASOS, uh whether they be

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,599
gene therapies or small molecules, etc.

87
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,920
I left uh that life, it seems like such

88
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,319
a long time ago, and basically joined a

89
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,599
non uh nonprofit organization, a

90
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,959
disability nonprofit in DC. and so spent

91
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,319
a lot of time um in DC working on the

92
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
hill and talking with various

93
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,400
communities like yourselves but also the

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
big D the big disability communities

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,640
with respect to physical and

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,920
non-physical um disabilities learned a

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,400
lot there it was quite an interesting

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,480
experience doing strategy in this time

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,480
and also business development but I

100
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,599
bring you back to where I am now as a

101
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,680
consultant so I lead Rarian which is a

102
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,000
brand of the uh rare collective

103
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,759
strategies LLC and has shaped my

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,160
perspective today which I hope will also

105
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,320
shape yours because again as I said

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,320
earlier empowerment having that

107
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,240
knowledge knowledge is power and

108
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
understanding what we're doing today

109
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
will help bring back and circle back to

110
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,160
you about how we could uh develop

111
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,320
therapies for the future. So I like to

112
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
look at this layer cake which you know

113
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,080
maybe some of you who are in New York

114
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,000
where you could find this layer cake. So

115
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
creating a layered community of

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,880
expertise and resources. You'll hear

117
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,880
that a lot from me and others as well as

118
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,960
we move forward with the talks to

119
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,680
actionable therapies. Right? So those

120
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,600
component parts are not so linear in the

121
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,240
journey. Right? And so all of the

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,400
stakeholder communities some shown here

123
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
include yourselves, families, patient

124
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,960
advocacy groups, organizations. Then you

125
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,000
have the researchers, clinicians and

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
scientists, academic partners, industry

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,440
also represented or well represented

128
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
here in the room in contract

129
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,720
organizations that help propel and

130
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,479
towards therapy. And finally, we have um

131
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,240
the entities that we need to interface

132
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,639
with to get approval and finally get

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,120
this two people right, regulatory

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,320
agencies all working together, but yet

135
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,560
not so linear as depicted in that slide.

136
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,680
And so many of you have participated in

137
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,759
the externally led PFDD meeting and that

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
um is now online was published in

139
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,880
November 3rd. I guess November 3rd it

140
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,880
was online. Um and I just want to uh

141
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,080
hope you appreciate these two uh arrows

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,919
here in orange where uh you all have

143
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,199
indicated that the most significant

144
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,759
impact on people with as communication,

145
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
daily living and cognition and the

146
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
priority for yourselves are

147
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
communication, seizures, lack of

148
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
mobility and sleep with respect to

149
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,120
treatment modalities.

150
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,600
But how does this all relate to invivo

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,400
models?

152
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,960
So why do we need those invivo models

153
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,039
and what is the value of them? Okay, so

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,800
what can we learn is one of the points

155
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,400
today. So these are the key takeaways

156
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,080
from my talk. So if you um basically

157
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,080
ignore everything, fall asleep, just

158
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,240
look at those four points right now.

159
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,919
What can we learn from invivo models? So

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,680
we're using models as tools to

161
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,520
understand the why. And I put in

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
parenthesis the mechanism. So sometimes

163
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,560
you might hear folks say, "Oh, well,

164
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,880
what's the mechanism? What's the

165
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,160
mechanism of action?" We do test in

166
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,880
mice, in rats, in other invivo models as

167
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,560
well to understand that. And models are

168
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,440
complex, right? These are all complex

169
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,319
systems, a complex path towards the end

170
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,479
goal of finding a therapy. So we want to

171
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,080
use those models to identify and

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,639
evaluate their utility with respect to

173
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,360
preclinical endpoints. So all of these

174
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
mouthfuls, right? Surrogate endpoints

175
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
you may hear as well. This is all our

176
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,160
constructs of interpretation when we

177
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,479
have an experiment that's designed,

178
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,080
that's tested, and then interpreted.

179
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
Right? So that's a very clear and

180
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,639
specific purpose. But what we're trying

181
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,280
to do is ensure that we're safeguarding

182
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,680
against any possible risk. So sometimes

183
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
you may hear de-risking, right, a

184
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,840
therapeutic asset when we consider the

185
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,400
next steps. I think that's important to

186
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,080
understand the limitations of the model.

187
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,960
Mice are not humans. So this idea of

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,360
anthropomorphizing very long word there

189
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,520
but basically mice will never be a

190
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,560
human. We could cure many conditions in

191
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,080
mice as well as other model systems but

192
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
at the end of the day the final

193
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,560
experiment the goal is to put it in a

194
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,720
person. I say it whatever that medicine

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,960
is an ASO a gene therapy etc. But it's

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,680
all adding to the body of evidence that

197
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,479
supports that drug development process.

198
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,039
So finally, how can we leverage these

199
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,960
tools, these models? So we evaluate

200
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,639
them, we compare and identify those

201
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,280
actionable therapies, whether they are

202
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,520
safe and effective, like I said earlier,

203
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,720
even if we don't have immediate answers

204
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,479
to all questions. So why wait, right? I

205
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,039
think many of you may agree with that

206
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,879
and resonates with you as well. So

207
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,879
sometimes when I speak to folks about

208
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
what they're doing in their labs or what

209
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,759
companies are working on, I like to

210
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,720
remind them as researchers, but also

211
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,959
beyond the research communities, the

212
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,519
stakeholders in the room, families that

213
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,839
to focus on your northstar, especially

214
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
when we think about model studies. And

215
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,240
so I have this diagram here, this

216
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,680
cartoon about community engagement going

217
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,000
through that process. So you are

218
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,240
engaged, you are here. The diagnostic

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
odyssey resolving well what is wrong

220
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,640
with my child? What is wrong with my

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,360
adult child etc. You're here you've had

222
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
that completed and then finally in vitro

223
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
modeling modeling which Michael

224
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,640
explained very well what can be done in

225
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,680
a dish. So invivo modeling is what we do

226
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,480
in a live organism and that's what's

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,240
referred to as invivo. But really at the

228
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,800
end of the day, we have these questions

229
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,800
and you could see we're trying to unpack

230
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,839
the when, where, what, why, and how.

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,560
Okay, what's the question? But we also

232
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,880
ask ourselves who's asking this question

233
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,959
and who benefits. And I think that's

234
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,360
important to keep in perspective. And

235
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,160
there's a matrix in that thought, right?

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,240
The end goal versus the motivation. As

237
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,040
it looks nice here in terms of that

238
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,360
matrix or that cross, it not doesn't

239
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,600
necessarily align, right? So we have to

240
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,279
also consider what are the incentives

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
when we're working with our

242
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,640
collaborators in this process

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,399
in the lab. If you say from a basic

244
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,880
science lab or translational science

245
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
lab, there are questions of discovery

246
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,480
based science and hypothesisbased

247
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,480
science. And so looking at some of these

248
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,839
features that are critical to the

249
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,880
community as you have articulated in the

250
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,760
uh report from the ELPFD,

251
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,279
communication, cognition, seizures,

252
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,399
motor, and sleep. Those are the symptoms

253
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,800
that were listed as being critical for

254
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,760
targeted therapeutics. So how does that

255
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,440
fit into using animal models and this

256
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,320
idea of discovery versus

257
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,120
hypothesis-based testing? So, I'm going

258
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,839
to go through examples and let me just

259
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,000
go back one slide. Um, here. Oh, okay.

260
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, it's not there. But follow the top

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,440
ticker, right? Because I'm going to go

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
through these examples of biology

263
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,399
model features. So, those are behavioral

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,240
features for example or phenotypes as

265
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,160
sometimes you might hear. And then

266
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
finally, develop therapies. And each of

267
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,680
these examples will be hit by the next

268
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,200
few slides. Okay. So why as models

269
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,279
matter and the lessons learned from

270
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,120
biology. So Seth Margolus will be

271
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,480
speaking next about the biology and

272
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
there are experts in this room who know

273
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,360
way more than me about Angelman syndrome

274
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,160
and how it's organized in terms of its

275
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,800
genomic organization. But the idea of

276
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,680
creating a mouse in which that mouse

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,240
lacks has been knocked out um or a

278
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,000
knockout mouse for Angelman syndrome was

279
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,760
back in 1998 when Yanquay in Art's lab

280
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,279
published this model of Angelman

281
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,200
syndrome that had the UB3A the Angelman

282
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,440
gene deleted from the maternal paternal

283
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,680
maternal alil right with the paternal

284
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,360
alil still reser uh retained and that

285
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
was also followed by several studies,

286
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,480
many studies I would say. So Ed Weieber

287
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,519
who you know in 2003 published after

288
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,600
that and and many others including uh

289
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,760
even today I was reading some papers

290
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,240
early this morning. So many people have

291
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,560
used this mouse model. the reason why

292
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,279
we're using the mouse for biology. So

293
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,519
that's one aspect of the value of model

294
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,480
systems is the high degree of similarity

295
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,360
with human UB3A again the gene that

296
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,440
causes Angelmen and it's informative

297
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,600
because it shows us how it's regulated.

298
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,839
How can we interrogate the system? How

299
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,800
can we design those experiments to test

300
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,040
hypotheses? But how can we also design

301
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,079
experiments so that we could understand

302
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,120
even beyond the that locus what might be

303
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,639
happening in an animal? Okay, again

304
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,200
animals not people, right? That's going

305
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,160
to inform us for the next steps that

306
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,639
opportunity. Can we take advantage of

307
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,600
what is happening in the system of the

308
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,519
machinery and leverage for example that

309
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,720
anti-sense transcript? Many of you have

310
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,240
heard looking at that blue arrow UB3A

311
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,480
ATS standing for anti-sense. Can we take

312
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,480
advantage to develop some kind of

313
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,839
therapy and there are other therapies

314
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,880
that are going to be talked about later

315
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,959
today including a very exciting talk um

316
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,959
that's tomorrow uh related to gene

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,360
therapy. Okay. So then you might ask

318
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,360
okay so you have a mouse model in hand

319
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,920
but why is it that I keep on hearing

320
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,839
about other models many other models

321
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,000
also a rat also a pig etc. Yes, I agree

322
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,399
with you. Right. Several animal models

323
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,800
have been made, but they have been made.

324
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,639
You have to ask again, why? Remember

325
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,720
that little cross that I showed you, the

326
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,800
goal versus the motivation. There are

327
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,360
variety of purposes for why we create

328
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,800
these model organisms, whether they be

329
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,279
mice, whether they be pigs, etc. This

330
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,440
table here uh was published from EP

331
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:38,240
Elgma's lab, which many of you may also

332
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,800
know, and it summarizes very nicely the

333
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,000
models um up to 2020. And there are new

334
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
models too. I you're going to hear a

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
talk today about a large deletion model

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,880
from Young Waste Lab. But the point is

337
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,160
is that researchers are seeking clarity

338
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,279
for both the biology and also seeking to

339
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,959
inform translational work in models.

340
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,160
Informing translational work

341
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,600
translational being in quotes there. I

342
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
think that's important to understand

343
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,320
because this idea of how does a mouse,

344
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,880
how does a model actually recapitulate

345
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,959
the features of a human or of a person

346
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,800
with Angelman syndrome, right? Looking

347
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,199
at these mice, would you ever be able to

348
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,000
tell, for example, that a mouse is less

349
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,079
social, has altered communication, has

350
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
mobility issues? No, they all look the

351
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,920
same, right? And so, how do we actually

352
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,440
go about testing these models? Um, I'm

353
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,360
going to give you some examples here,

354
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,839
right? Again, I like to emphasize mice

355
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,320
are not people with a exclamation point

356
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,560
there. And I think you've might get sick

357
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,360
of me saying that, but that's really the

358
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,240
point for moving forward with why these

359
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,800
models matter and still and will

360
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,880
continue to matter in the future, right?

361
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,279
So we try to learn from some of their

362
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,839
inherent natural behaviors and

363
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,839
understand what is different between an

364
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,360
animal model like a mouse that doesn't

365
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,519
have any UB3A being expressed versus an

366
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,760
animal model a mouse that is

367
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,880
neurotypical or typical developing right

368
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,959
so basically um completely intact.

369
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,560
That's called a wild type mouse. So if

370
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,800
you hear wild type that's what it refers

371
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,399
to. But we've tried to test these

372
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
animals not just for their natural

373
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
behavior, but how they also perform in a

374
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,440
variety of tasks. So we're looking at

375
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,480
performance and using our lens of

376
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,880
interpretation to see if we alter this

377
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,760
gene and that relates to alterations in

378
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,920
a brain circuit, how does that relate to

379
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,240
the behavioral readout? And then

380
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,560
finally, how can we take that readout

381
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,680
and leverage it for the purpose of a

382
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,680
preclinical study to test a therapeutic?

383
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,399
So when you hear behavior in animal

384
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,320
models like mice, you may wonder, okay,

385
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,639
is this something new? Like, did we make

386
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,839
this up? Like, no. No. I mean, this has

387
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,120
been around for a long time. I mean,

388
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,920
yeah. Well, I mean, it's been studied

389
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,839
since 1907 in which this is, you can

390
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,839
find this online. It's free. The dancing

391
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,680
mouse, uh, it was published by Jüks, so

392
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,240
who was a behavioral psychologist at the

393
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,560
time, and it was the first report of a

394
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
behavioral evaluation in a mouse model.

395
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,519
And this mouse was called the dancing

396
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,079
mouse. So it was jumping around and had

397
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,560
some kind of mobility issue. What they

398
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,759
found was that there was an inner ear

399
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,560
defect, some morphological defect. And

400
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,120
what they did was take the mouse and

401
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,720
breed it. And this alluded to the

402
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,959
genetics in terms of the genetic

403
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,959
inheritance of the animal model over

404
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,519
time even though they didn't have that

405
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,519
information. But to this point is that

406
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,160
the behavior and the mechanism go hand

407
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,160
in hand. So when we're studying Angelman

408
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
syndrome mouse models, we're also trying

409
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,880
to do the same when we test them in

410
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,880
behavioral assays. If you go online and

411
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,600
look up Jill Silverman, she's done a ton

412
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,519
of work related to modeling behavioral

413
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,279
features as well as Michael Cidarov, I

414
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,000
think he was here yesterday or in the in

415
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,120
the room um behavioral features in

416
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,560
models of AS and many of them are in

417
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,560
cases reproducible and reliable. But

418
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,600
that altered behavioral features in as

419
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,559
mice is only one entry point to test in

420
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,799
vivo. So in a living organism, what

421
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,280
happens? What are the consequences? What

422
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,480
are the benefits when you administer a

423
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,319
drug in a freely moving animal? So

424
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,520
lessons learned from model features. I'm

425
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
going to just go over these two

426
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,000
examples. Um, when you hear open field

427
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
activity and marble burring, you may

428
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,919
wonder, what are they even talking about

429
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,559
when you're putting a mouse and looking

430
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
at it in an open field or having a mouse

431
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,760
play with marbles? Like, what does that

432
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,760
even mean? So, open field is a test in

433
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,919
which you put a mouse in a chamber and

434
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,440
it's measuring its activity

435
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,000
spontaneously

436
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
in a freely moving animal and uses

437
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,919
infrared beam to detect movement. And

438
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,320
so, this is an automated test. you put

439
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,720
the mouse in and you let it go ahead and

440
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,880
do its thing and what you can measure is

441
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,400
the distance traveled and that's a

442
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,280
surrogate for I would say mobility right

443
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,600
uh and movement conditions or disability

444
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:05,360
and so in that graph there and this is

445
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,760
published from a paper uh from eBay Igma

446
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,840
and Michael Cidarov uh where they looked

447
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,919
at the Angelmen mice and tried to

448
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,840
identify what is the most reproducible

449
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,960
reliable endpoints when we think about

450
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:19,840
behavior um in these mice and so they

451
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,080
found that comparing black to red there

452
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,880
was a reduction in distance traveled

453
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,960
right so this is looking at the y ais

454
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,760
that's basically distance traveled

455
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,400
movement and then the x-axis wt standing

456
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,600
for wild type as standing for angelman

457
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,480
syndrome mouse to the right you see

458
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,960
marble burring okay so marble burring is

459
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,480
a test in which there's a cage and

460
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,799
there's bedding on it you put the

461
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
marbles there and you see how many

462
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,120
marbles are are buried by the mouse

463
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,280
after a period of time. And so you may

464
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,840
wonder how does this relate, right?

465
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Again, we're trying to use the mouse as

466
00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,320
a tractable system to manipulate the

467
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,160
genetics and then test the performance.

468
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,799
And so putting a mouse in this cage with

469
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,840
the marbles, you'll find that it will

470
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,720
display some kind of repetitive behavior

471
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,039
when it comes to digging and burring the

472
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
marbles, actively burring them. And so

473
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,120
some people interpret this as

474
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,880
perverative behavior. Others inter

475
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,520
interpret this as avoidance or

476
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,000
anxiety-like behavior. For us in the

477
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,600
room, if you would say talking to the

478
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
disability community, talking to rare

479
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,240
genetic families, what does that even

480
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,080
mean when I'm thinking about my child,

481
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,240
right? And that's the point, right? This

482
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,720
is the end point. This is a surrogate

483
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,960
endpoint or readout for what might be

484
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,440
happening when you manipulate one

485
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,600
variable and test another measurement.

486
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,799
And so looking to the right you see a

487
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,799
graph again blue and red sorry black and

488
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,880
red black black corresponding to the

489
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,679
typical developing mouse wild type and

490
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,760
red to the angelman uh mouse you see a

491
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,039
reduction in the number number of

492
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:01,760
marbles buried so at the bottom I think

493
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,440
that's an important point um to consider

494
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,840
what does this mean to you right and

495
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,880
what does it mean to us and actually

496
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,280
from a person centered perspective again

497
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,880
empowering you with this knowledge is

498
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
important because you could understand

499
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,440
realistic expectations when you see

500
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,039
papers that are published whether or not

501
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,799
there's a correction in marble bearing

502
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,520
whether or not there's a correction in

503
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,919
open field what does that mean for the

504
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,400
science and leveraging the potential

505
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,640
what we say proof of concept study

506
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,039
moving forward for therapy development

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,600
or for the drug development process but

508
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,440
we also embrace the model's limitation

509
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,200
and that's the importance there we need

510
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,679
to have that trust in the science and

511
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,480
what people are doing here today. What

512
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,960
fast is supporting with respect to the

513
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,520
researchers and and the other academics

514
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,360
and clinicians and that process of

515
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,280
science itself and the drug development

516
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,919
process. Finally, I'm going to go over

517
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,559
this third example where developing

518
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,720
therapies. So, where models really are

519
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:05,039
helpful towards understanding if they

520
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,360
can be used for proof of concept

521
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,280
studies. And I put that in quotes. Proof

522
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,280
of concept. So, what does that mean?

523
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,600
Does it mean it means that we're trying

524
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,520
to design test and interpret the

525
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,559
findings from a potential early stage

526
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,240
asset I say asset so whether that be a

527
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,039
gene therapy whether that be a small

528
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,679
molecule and understand in a whole

529
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,320
animal freely moving intact not a

530
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,039
reduced cellular preparation what

531
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,240
happens when you take that drug and put

532
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,480
it in that living thing. So I had said

533
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,240
earlier I was talking about Marbleberg I

534
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,919
was talking about open field. We're

535
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,799
trying to see if there is an improvement

536
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,520
there. But we're also looking at an

537
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,679
example here um and this is the ASO that

538
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,080
was first published in 2014 um by

539
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,360
Arpodet lab in Linen Mang was a graduate

540
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:58,080
student at the time and we're looking at

541
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,159
molecular readouts as well. And so you

542
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,320
see this kind of gray and black thing to

543
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,280
the right that is called a western blot

544
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,400
image. And so you see bands, you see

545
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,240
letters, and you're like, "What is

546
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
that?" Just look at the arrow. Okay?

547
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,400
Looking at the arrow, you could see this

548
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,760
band of three under PBS and a band of

549
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,520
three under ASO. In between, you see no

550
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,760
bands, right? And so what this is

551
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,360
telling us is that the typical

552
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,679
developing animal expresses UB3A

553
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,960
and then the animal that has been

554
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:34,799
administered in ASO has some improvement

555
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,200
in UB3A expression specifically protein.

556
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,840
And so this was really exciting for the

557
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,400
entire field as it's represented using

558
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,440
an invivo model that is a genetic

559
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,520
deletion a knockout of the UB3A gene the

560
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:52,400
Angelman syndrome gene plus the ASO to

561
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,640
basically block the anti-sense uh

562
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,080
transcript. You could derpress that

563
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,320
paternal expression and allow what's

564
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:03,760
already present to do its thing to

565
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,080
basically make UB3 protein. So very

566
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,240
exciting time and it's exciting time

567
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,039
today because we're building that body

568
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,520
of evidence through these models. So

569
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,200
model systems again understanding their

570
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,039
limitations but also their importance

571
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,159
has made possible the ability to expand,

572
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:24,720
develop and pursue novel new therapeutic

573
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,679
modalities as well as develop additional

574
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,080
types of ASOs that may potential may

575
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,520
potentially have value for uh the

576
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
community.

577
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,799
I don't know why it looks like that, but

578
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
basically

579
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,520
these are just screenshots of some of

580
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,120
the examples of ASOS to the far left of

581
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,120
papers that have published. But who

582
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,840
cares about papers? I mean, we do care

583
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,919
about papers. At the end of the day, the

584
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,400
papers are good because they demonstrate

585
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,880
we're reporting back what has been

586
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,440
invested in. So that ROI, that return on

587
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
investment papers again, the incentives

588
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,600
need to align. That's the currency for

589
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,760
the academics. But the currency for

590
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,840
people is getting that to clinic,

591
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,159
getting that to a person. So

592
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,480
transforming what is a big dream or

593
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,240
dreams to reality is what we're trying

594
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,840
to do today and move that forward. In

595
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,679
the middle you could see there's a

596
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,720
crisper a modality. You heard that from

597
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,360
Michael. So another way to basically

598
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,360
improve a phenotype in a mouse. At the

599
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,120
bottom was one of the first uh I think

600
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,919
it was the first study related to gene

601
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,760
therapy in a different type of context.

602
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,400
And you're going to hear this tomorrow

603
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,159
from an exciting group at UCLA that's

604
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,640
moving the gene therapy approach

605
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,039
forward, which Allison has shared with

606
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,159
me at a meeting last week. It looks

607
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,320
really exciting. Okay, so I'm going to

608
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,400
end my talk here, but key takeaways on

609
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,480
the value of invivo models and why we

610
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
need them. Those four orange points,

611
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,039
like I said, if you totally checked out,

612
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,200
I get it and I totally understand. It's

613
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,520
early. It's Saturday. You all are here.

614
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,760
But those four orange points are

615
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,679
important takeaways. So what can we

616
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,400
learn using those models as tools?

617
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,880
Understanding the why complex systems.

618
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
We know that these are all complex but

619
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,600
we want to understand the models

620
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,240
themselves. Can we leverage them?

621
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,159
Identify preclinical endpoints. Those

622
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,960
surrogate endpoints that we have

623
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,799
interpreted as a community that may be

624
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,840
then leveraged as tools for a clear and

625
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,919
specific purpose. safeguarding again

626
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,559
against possible issues and concerns in

627
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,679
the process. And then finally, as I

628
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,640
said, leveraging basically understanding

629
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,279
if a drug is safe and effective even if

630
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,200
we don't understand what it's all doing

631
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,840
or we don't understand all the bio

632
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
biology. And with that, I would like to

633
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,240
thank you, you all for being here,

634
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,480
Allison, the fast leadership and team,

635
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,712
and our summit sponsors and exhibitors.

636
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,732
It's been a fantastic time. Thank you.

637
00:25:51,712 --> 00:25:53,732
>> [applause]

638
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,679
>> That was that was wonderful and I think

639
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,600
we all appreciate uh the value of models

640
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,840
and we also appreciate moving on from

641
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,840
models.
