1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Our next presentation is actually a

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,319
video. It's Dr. Annne Wheeler.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,759
Unfortunately, she couldn't be here with

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,440
us today, but she'll be here tomorrow.

5
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,280
She promises. We'll see what happens

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
with the shutdown. Maybe that'll change.

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,240
Um, but she's going to present to us on

8
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,240
the development of the measure for the

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,759
observable outcomes of distress and

10
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,759
Angelmen syndrome, the mood as

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,600
hi everyone. I'm so sorry to not be

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,199
there in person today. What an amazing

13
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
meeting it's been. I hope everyone's

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
enjoying themselves and learning a lot.

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,800
Here I want to share with you some

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,880
initial findings from our effort to

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,559
better understand behaviors in Angelmen

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,000
syndrome, especially those that appear

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,000
to be related to anxiety or distress.

20
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,440
Many of you have told us that your loved

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,200
one with Angelmen experiences anxiety.

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,440
And many of you also describe behaviors

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,840
like aggression or clinginess. But

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
anxiety is considered an internal issue,

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
meaning that we can we as observers

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,360
cannot determine for sure that an

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,719
individual is experiencing anxiety

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,800
unless they are able to tell us

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,960
themselves, which of course is a major

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
challenge for individuals with Angelmen.

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,479
And so we have set out to develop a

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,960
measure that uses only observed

33
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,960
behaviors in order to understand how

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,520
anxiety as described by a caregiver um

35
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,439
is manifesting in Angelmen.

36
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,799
All phases of the study that I'm going

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,439
to describe have been done in

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,880
collaboration between the United States

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,759
folks um RTI and uh the natural history

40
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,240
study as well as the Arasmus Center in

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,920
the Netherlands and the pro this program

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,920
has been funded by the Angelman Syndrome

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Foundation.

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
So we took a four-phase approach to

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
developing this measure. The first thing

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
we did was do some concept elicitation

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,960
interviews with families. Then we

48
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
decided how those items that we heard

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
from interviews mapped on to other

50
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,880
measures, developed a new measure, did

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
some cognitive interviewing, and are now

52
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,680
in the phase of collecting data on the

53
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,759
existing measure.

54
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,840
In the first phase, we conducted 23

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,280
interviews with caregivers, about half

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
of whom had an individual with a

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,159
deletion subtype and the other half had

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,920
an individual with a non-deion subtype.

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
Almost all of these caregivers reported

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,680
behaviors associated with anxiety in

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,440
their loved ones with common behaviors

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,920
including things like freezing,

63
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
flinching more, crying, hand flapping,

64
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,000
and aggression. These interviews also

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,360
allowed us to understand a bit more

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
about what families mean when they

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
describe some behaviors. For example,

68
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,560
clingy was endorsed by nearly 80% of the

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,319
sample. But when we asked about what

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,160
clingy looks like, we found that that

71
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,000
could mean anything from increased

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,920
increased whining when left alone,

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,519
watching the caregivers's every move,

74
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,840
holding on to the caregiver, or

75
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,440
aggressive behavior towards others. So

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,360
this helped us understand the types of

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,959
observable behaviors we can ask more

78
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,160
about to understand what clinginess

79
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,000
looks like for that individual.

80
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,000
After this, we developed a long list of

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,760
behaviors we heard parents describe and

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,239
limited those behaviors to ones that can

83
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,840
be observed by others. The final list of

84
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,159
69 behaviors are ranked on two scales. A

85
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,680
frequency scale from never to often and

86
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,319
a severity scale from mild to severe.

87
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,480
This set of items makes up what we're

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,080
now calling the measure of observable

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
outcomes of distress in Angelmen

90
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,159
syndrome or the mood as before we

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,319
launched this measure to get

92
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,239
psychometric data. We did some cognitive

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,840
testing with 14 caregivers where we

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,599
asked them to give us feedback on the

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,360
clarity of the items and how well it

96
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,680
represents their loved one with Angelman

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
syndrome. We got very positive feedback

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,159
with only minor revisions to wording and

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,480
of instructions, severity items and some

100
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,480
impact items.

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
So we are now in the psychometric

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,640
evaluation period with data being

103
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,480
collected through oneoff surveys in

104
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,480
multiple countries and sites as well as

105
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
through the natural history study. This

106
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,000
phase is just getting started, so we

107
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,000
don't have much data yet. But from the

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,480
first 31 participants, it seems that the

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,200
most frequently endorsed behaviors are

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,720
easily distracted, refusing to separate,

111
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,040
pulling on others, and mouththing

112
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
behaviors. The most severe behaviors

113
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,640
include reduced communication when

114
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,560
upset, biting nails, checking the time,

115
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,159
lying down, and mouththing behaviors.

116
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,760
Once we have enough data, we will be

117
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,120
able to use this information to better

118
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,959
understand the extent of behavior

119
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,639
challenges in Angelmen and perhaps be

120
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,079
able to categorize the behaviors into

121
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
clusters that can help us get to the

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,600
root and function of these behaviors to

123
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,759
better help address the distress being

124
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
experienced by the individual. We have

125
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,960
an initial idea of how these behaviors

126
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,720
might cluster, including clusters that

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,280
may point directly to function, for

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,440
example, communication versus avoided

129
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
related distress. Stay tuned for more

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
information about this measure in the

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
next year.

132
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,840
If you are a caregiver interested in

133
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,919
completing the mood as to contribute to

134
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,680
data on this topic or if you are a

135
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,600
researcher or clinician interested in

136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,199
using the mood as in your setting,

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,759
please contact me and we would love to

138
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,199
collaborate. My Sarah my colleague Sarah

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,800
Potter who has been involved in the

140
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
development of this measure is there at

141
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,160
the conference right now and I will be

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
there on Saturday if any of you want to

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
find us to ask questions and discuss

144
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,440
more about this tool. Thank you so much

145
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,840
for your time. I look forward to seeing

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,840
you all on Saturday.
