1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,839
Our next speakers, we have a tag team um

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,599
of Dr. Jim Wilson from historically I'm

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,200
gonna you good you turn that off for me.

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,599
Um from the University of Pennsylvania

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
now at Gemma Gemma Biootherrapeutics and

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,760
Dr. Elizabeth Barry Cravis who no one

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,520
needs to introduce um who is the

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,520
director of the fast translational

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,600
neuroscience research center at Rush

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,000
University Medical Center. But before

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,920
they get on the stage I wanted to share

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,720
something with you. I won't take too

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,440
much of your time.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,440
I want to share with you a moment

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
because I think it's really critical and

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,600
I think you saw it in our in the last

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,920
speaker as well but I was searching for

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,360
how long we've been talking to Jim and

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,399
as you know Jim's been here and coming

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,680
to this conference since 2016

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
and we've been talking about a gene

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,440
therapy for Angelmen syndrome since that

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:02,239
time and I dug in to see when we talked

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,879
for the first time. June 17th, 2016.

25
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:08,400
An email subject gene therapy and

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,080
angelman syndrome. Dear Dr. Wilson, I

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,479
want to reach out to you in hopes to

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,640
have a more serious conversation about

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,760
the the potential to work with you and

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
your team at the University of

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,520
Pennsylvania and helping to push a gene

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,439
therapy program forward for Angelmen

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,200
Syndrome. You seem like the perfect

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,520
person to collaborate with, having a

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
sense of urgency and rigor. I'm a

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,560
veterinarian that trained at the

37
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
veterary hospital of the University of

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,320
Pennsylvania and was an assistant

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
professor there prior to starting my own

40
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
clinical research program in New York

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,479
City. I'm a veterinary internist and

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,159
interventional radiologist and run a

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,560
research program on various medical

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,280
devices and autogenous

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,119
and allergenic stem cell therapy in

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
delivery for regenerative medicine for

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,960
different complicated and challen

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,880
challenging diseases. I've been running

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,799
clinical trials my entire career on the

50
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,439
veterinary side using natural models of

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
disease. I get calls daily from

52
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,600
desperate pet owners looking for hope

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,520
for treatments for their loved ones.

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Well, one and a half years ago, I got on

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,040
the other side of that phone call when

56
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,759
my daughter was diagnosed with Angelmen

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,239
syndrome. If you are unaware, this is a

58
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,239
rare monogenic neurogenetic disorder

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,239
affecting one in 12,000 people that

60
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
involves a missing or mutated gene on

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,800
chromosome 15. This gene is known as

62
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,879
UB3A. And this has pretty dramatic

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
effects on children resulting in

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,000
developmental delays, intractable

65
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
seizures, lack of speech, ataxi,

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,480
dyspraxia, and sleep issues. The good

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
news is that the condition has not been

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
associated with any degenerative changes

69
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,840
in the brain and the brain is

70
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,959
anatomically normal. This gene is

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,280
imprinted, but it has lack of expression

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,879
only in neurons.

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
So there's a perfectly normal copy on

74
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,400
the paternal alil. This condition has

75
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
been treated with various forms of gene

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,720
therapy and gene editing and we're now

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,840
aiming to move this forward to bring

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,680
this to clinical trials in humans. The

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
clinical work, the pre-clinical work is

80
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,040
done, but we would love to have the help

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,440
of someone like you and your team to

82
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,280
help us bring this to our children. We

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,000
know this is possible and we want to do

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,440
this now. Since our diagnosis, I have

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,519
gotten very involved in the foundation

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
for Angelmen Syndrome Therapeutics and I

87
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,920
have recently been asked to join their

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,319
board of directors and become their

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,159
chief science officer. I have been

90
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,760
working closely with a consortium of

91
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,040
scientists that are incredible and have

92
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
been involved in bringing meaningful

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,599
therapeutics to these children. Gene

94
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,200
therapy is our goal. We are on a mission

95
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,200
to get this to our kids in the short

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,920
shortest possible timelines, but we must

97
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,920
ensure rigor and safety. A paper was

98
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,840
published which I have attached for you

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,200
showing that this can be done in the

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,879
adult mouse model. We want to get this

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
and the best people on board to move

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,920
this forward to our children. And I

103
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,720
would love the opportunity to talk to

104
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,480
you more about where we are and if your

105
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,080
team would be willing at the University

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,519
of Pennsylvania to take this on. I sent

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:01,760
that email on June 17th at 12:48 p.m. I

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,439
received a response on June 17th at 6:03

109
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,680
p.m. His response, "Thank you for your

110
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,000
note. I will be in touch once I have a

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,280
chance to talk to my team, Jim."

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,720
He is a man of few words,

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:23,120
but he never let that go. And I can tell

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,639
you now since that first email in 2016,

115
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,759
I have 1,672

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,759
emails with Dr. Jim Wilson.

117
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,960
So that just shows you the power of

118
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,960
parents. We did this with Dr. Conn. We

119
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,600
did this with Dr. Wilson. And I did this

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,199
with Yang Jiang. And I probably have

121
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,960
5,787

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,440
emails with Yang. But with that, I am so

123
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,759
happy to present to you Dr. Dr. Jim

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,960
Wilson and Dr. Elizabeth Barry Cravis.

125
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,919
If both of you want to come up on the

126
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,600
stage to talk about MVX220, a gene

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,600
replacement therapy for Angelmen

128
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,600
syndrome.

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,360
It's a pleasure to be back. Been here

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,520
many times. When I was preparing to

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,840
travel yesterday, I talked to my wife,

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,960
Lisa, 42 years, and told her that I

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,800
think there's really an important

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,840
milestone that we're going to be able to

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,880
discuss. And she turned to me and she

136
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,880
said, "What took you so long?

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
Uh she feels a sense of urgency as well.

138
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,919
So, it's really a pleasure to be up here

139
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,440
with Liz and uh to give you an update on

140
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,720
the status of the program that we've

141
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,720
been talking to you about for quite a

142
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,720
while.

143
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,000
as as I thought about how to develop

144
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,680
gene therapy um broadly uh during the

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
time that I've been involved in the

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,039
field,

147
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,240
we we think about what's called a

148
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,240
platform. And what is a platform? Here's

149
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,479
an example of a of treatment of a

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
disease with an AV vector where we

151
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,720
insert a gene into the vector and treat

152
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,720
patients with a disease. A platform uh

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,120
is such that all you do is just swap out

154
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,840
the gene to treat a different disease

155
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
and just iterate this

156
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,199
and this is the platform that we've

157
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
developed that we wanted to deploy for

158
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,199
Angelman syndrome. So what are the

159
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,160
advantages or what are the features of a

160
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,080
platform? Uh the features are often

161
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,639
there are common disease pathologies but

162
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,080
most importantly uh the same target

163
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,360
cells that we want to achieve. They're

164
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
not liver cells. They're they're

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,520
neurons. The same delivery vehicle, the

166
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,240
capsid, the same route of

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,960
administration, the same dose, and the

168
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,560
same manufacturing process. If if we can

169
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,800
capture a platform with all those

170
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,280
similarities, then there's significant

171
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,520
advantages. One of which is the chances

172
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,919
of a success after we've had a success

173
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,720
are much higher. Uh the chances of

174
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,520
safety, if it's been safe, are also much

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,560
higher. uh it simplifies the path to the

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,680
clinic, accelerates timelines which are

177
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,080
always important uh and it is more

178
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,440
efficient from a fundraising or a

179
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
capital standpoint. So the the platform

180
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,199
that we've been developing over many

181
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,199
years for treating CNS disease is again

182
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,000
what we engage with Allison and uh after

183
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,080
she first contacted us.

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,800
But with that said, uh I would like to

185
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,759
describe uh a way in which many have

186
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,080
tried to treat diseases of muscle and

187
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,160
brain by injecting a vector in into the

188
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,599
uh circulation or the blood to target

189
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
these organs. And the reason I bring

190
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,919
this up is because there has been a lot

191
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,080
of toxicity that has been highly

192
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,680
publicized and it's something I wanted

193
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,560
to bring up here and we can also talk

194
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,080
about at the panel. What I show here is

195
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,080
an experiment that I did with Ron

196
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,440
Crystal where we actually put a radio

197
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,599
label on our vector so we could trace

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,199
it. Uh and these experiments were done

199
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,280
in a monkey. You can see the outline of

200
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,319
the monkey there. Uh so when you inject

201
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,879
a vector into the blood uh and it

202
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,280
highlights as black.

203
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,120
The organ that takes the vector up

204
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
primarily is the liver and you can see

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
how dark it is. And the reason is that

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,680
the the capillaries have large holes in

207
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
them. And a vector is a large molecule.

208
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,560
So the the liver is sort of like a

209
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,640
sponge and it goes to the liver. But in

210
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
order for a vector to get from the blood

211
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,560
to the brain, you have to cross the

212
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,839
bloodb brain barrier. Uh and that's hard

213
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,000
to do. And in this example of a first

214
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:48,240
generation uh vector injected IV, you do

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,440
not see the brain lighting up. So as I

216
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,440
through many years of experience in many

217
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,720
different trials, we've developed a

218
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,760
model for how an intravenously delivered

219
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,480
AAV will function in targeting the

220
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:08,240
organs of of interest. And in this

221
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,560
figure I have uh on the um y ais the the

222
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,000
number of vector genomes that get into a

223
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,160
tissue and versus dose and dose is

224
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,800
really important. So as we increase dose

225
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,480
from 10 the 12th to 10 the 14th the

226
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,880
liver is the organ that usually takes it

227
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,279
up first then ultimately the heart and

228
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
then muscle and brain but in order to

229
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,320
get vector into muscle and brain

230
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,040
requires very high doses a number that

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,080
is important to know is 10 the 14 genome

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,000
copies per kilogram. This is where we

233
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,560
start to see toxicity that can be

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,720
lethal. So the so-called therapeutic

235
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,959
window, the difference between getting a

236
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,200
vector into the brain versus where we're

237
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,440
going to have severe toxicity is very

238
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
short. Uh although there is an approved

239
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,959
product for treating a neurologic

240
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,080
disease, spinal muscular atrophy type

241
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,440
one uh which it can cure patients but

242
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,080
also associated with a lot of toxicity.

243
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,160
So what we decided to do was to try a

244
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,240
different approach uh where we would

245
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,440
inject a vector not through the blood to

246
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,000
get to the bloodb brain barrier but

247
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,640
injected into the cerebral spinal fluid.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,200
Uh and this is a an experiment in this

249
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,839
same monkey model comparing the

250
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,560
distribution of the vector um when you

251
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,440
inject it into the the vein again you

252
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,440
see the the liver exposed but when you

253
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
inject the vector into the cerebral

254
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,000
spinal fluid it's a very different

255
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,160
picture. Now uh I'm going to point out

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
uh in a minute different ways to inject

257
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,920
a vector in the cerebral spinal fluid

258
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,079
but the way that we decided to proceed

259
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,839
is to inject it in access point of the

260
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,399
cerebral spinal fluid closer to the

261
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,959
brain which is called the sister magna.

262
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,440
So when you compare an intravenous dose

263
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,079
versus

264
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,640
an ICM which is a cyestern maganga

265
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,200
approach you see far less in liver and

266
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,880
much more in brain. I also thought it

267
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,640
would be important to bring up to the

268
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,200
community well why don't we just inject

269
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,200
a vector into the lumbar space because

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,519
this is the route of administration many

271
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,440
of you are used to for anti-sense aligan

272
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,000
nucleotides. So we did an experiment

273
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,920
directly comparing the same dose of

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
vector in the cesterna magna versus a

275
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,399
lumbar injection. Uh this is the

276
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,720
cesterna magna and this is the lumbar

277
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,279
injection in monkeys. And you can see

278
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,440
that uh it really doesn't get to the

279
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,600
brain AV vectors when injected through

280
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,079
the lumbar space as opposed to ASOs that

281
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,399
do. Although if you wanted to treat a

282
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,240
disease that affected the spinal cord,

283
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,560
uh this may be okay. So that's why we

284
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,360
selected the ICM and we're going to hear

285
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,360
some exciting work in the next talk by a

286
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,720
company called Epura where they're

287
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,560
actually trying to engineer the AAV to

288
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,519
more efficiently cross this bloodb brain

289
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,160
barrier. Um,

290
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,079
so what would this mean when you think

291
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,760
about what you've heard for the studies

292
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:03,040
of neurologic treatments, even RED

293
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,320
syndrome and others with an IV approach.

294
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,560
Um, this is uh sort of pictorially the

295
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,639
quantity of vector you would need. But

296
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,880
for an ICM approach, it's about

297
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,360
depending on the size of the patient up

298
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,760
to 20fold less. So that means there'll

299
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,360
be less exposure to the vector and also

300
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,240
less to make and potentially cheaper uh

301
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:28,720
to develop.

302
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,800
So we spent um most of the last 10 to 15

303
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,760
years doing a lot of things but one of

304
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,160
which is to developing this platform in

305
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,639
a way in which we could evaluate safety

306
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,320
and efficacy and it was really focusing

307
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,320
on diseases in which there is a

308
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,800
bystander effect like we think there is

309
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
for Angelmen. But these are lethal

310
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,519
pediatric diseases of really no

311
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,200
treatment. And this is our CNS platform

312
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,160
that we called. So there's this delivery

313
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,160
vehicle called the AV vector. We keep

314
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,120
that the same because we want a lot of

315
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,600
sameness in the platform. It's a Cerna

316
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,839
Magna delivery.

317
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,959
A manufacturing process we've kept the

318
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:10,160
same. It's a it's a fermentation

319
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,880
approach. And over the years, we vetted

320
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:17,040
this and 500 over well over 500 571

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,120
non-human primates or monkeys in various

322
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,600
different ways to make sure we had a

323
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,040
good handle on safety.

324
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,279
So then over these years uh we've uh

325
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,120
started companies, we've licensed these

326
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,040
programs into these companies and I'll

327
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,639
just give you an update on that because

328
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,639
this is the context in which we're

329
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,200
bringing forward gene therapy for

330
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,440
Angelman syndrome. So starting with

331
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
Hunter syndrome uh started a company

332
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,200
called Regenics Bio. Uh this product

333
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
should be approved in February. So

334
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,880
that'll be a really important

335
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,720
achievement for the platform. There's

336
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,320
another disease called Hurler syndrome

337
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,279
very similar finish phase one two is in

338
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
uh uh pivotal studies. Uh at that point

339
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,320
the company didn't want to do any more

340
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,440
of what I asked them to do. So I had to

341
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,560
start another company called uh um

342
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Gemmaab Bio. And we've spun out this uh

343
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,320
subsidiary called Rare for very severe

344
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,880
lethal infantile diseases. GM1 finished

345
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
phase one studies talking to FDA about

346
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,680
BLAS's

347
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,240
uh crab a uh inphase one studies again

348
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,959
lethal in the first two years of age and

349
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,440
then metacromatic lucodistrophe.

350
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,480
What this has provided us through the

351
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,720
platform approach is an idea of safety

352
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,880
from a procedural standpoint and also

353
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,120
from a product standpoint and we have a

354
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,959
pretty good experience in terms of

355
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,959
safety. You can never rule something

356
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,639
rule out something happening but is this

357
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,160
background of safety that I began uh to

358
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,680
develop more comfort in bringing this

359
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,920
forward with Angelman syndrome. The

360
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,160
other thing is the efficacy data of gene

361
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,000
transfer and the durability that we saw

362
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,680
in the mouse models actually translated

363
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,240
into humans. So one one aspect uh that

364
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,040
Liz may comment on is the is the route

365
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,560
of administration which uh we like it to

366
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,880
be close to the brain so it would get to

367
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,000
the brain and it's the ICM delivery.

368
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,240
Just to give you an idea of the

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,320
experience, uh these are centers around

370
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,279
the world where PEN interventional

371
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,959
radiologists have trained operators by

372
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,839
bringing them into our uh IR suites and

373
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,760
proctoring them uh on human cadaavvers

374
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,519
or on monkeys to asssure that they're

375
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,839
capable of doing the procedure. It's a

376
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,320
single injection like a lumbar

377
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,560
injection. So 42 hospitals with trained

378
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,079
physicians, 18 companies have sought our

379
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,800
help and the age range in which this has

380
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,279
uh been delivered is between six months

381
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,279
to 80 years of age. And the rock star

382
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,600
here is Brian Pukamis who's really t

383
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,199
took it upon himself after a brief

384
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,560
conversation I had with him many years

385
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,800
ago uh to uh to promote and to asssure

386
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,360
that any product that's delivered this

387
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,959
way, it's delivered safely.

388
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,839
So the timeline uh that um uh Allison

389
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,440
had described and that my wife commented

390
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,440
on uh is how long it took. So we we

391
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,160
published our first paper on an ICM

392
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,120
delivery in monkeys in 2014

393
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,360
and in 2018 was the first patient dose

394
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,160
with MPS2.

395
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,519
Soon thereafter, MPS1 had to start

396
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,240
another company and then GM1 and then

397
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,480
Crab A and ultimately the first approved

398
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,199
product uh hopefully will be February of

399
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,519
this year. And as we were proceeding

400
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,680
with this program, we were considering

401
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,320
other applications including Angelmen

402
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,320
and we were fortunate to receive our

403
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,720
first grant from FAST to get us dialed

404
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,440
into Angelmen syndrome in 2017.

405
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,839
uh uh made the first vector, did the

406
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,920
first mouse, did primate studies, and

407
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,120
all looked like it was tracking. And

408
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,759
then fortunately um we were able to

409
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000
continue to work with fast uh to

410
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,560
progress this program, and we had an IND

411
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,560
open uh in April of this year. And as

412
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,720
Liz's going to describe, the first

413
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:06,799
patient dosed uh just last week. So um

414
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,839
before I pass it off, I I just want to

415
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,839
take a Thank you.

416
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:22,160
Just really want to thank um fast uh AS2

417
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
Bio and Gemmaab Bio uh Heather Bourne

418
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,959
and Juliet Hordo the ones that really

419
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,400
toiled in the lab uh to do all this work

420
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,559
are with us today and uh thank them.

421
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,080
Thank you for your confidence, your

422
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,080
patience. Uh, and at this point, um,

423
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,120
it's an extreme pleasure for me to

424
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,320
so-called pass the baton, uh, to Liz,

425
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,280
and she's going to tell you about the

426
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,280
trial. So, thank you very much.

427
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Okay, it's like I can advance it myself.

428
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,840
Yes. All right. Um, I'm going to talk to

429
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,000
you about the trial and um, thanks Jim

430
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,320
for that great introduction and all the

431
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,840
work that led up to this. I I'm really

432
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160
just standing on the backs of all the

433
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,799
people who have gone before and done all

434
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,840
the development. And so um I'm going to

435
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,799
describe the trial which is called MVX

436
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,640
AAV1 and it's the first in human phase

437
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,840
one two trial of an AAV hue 68 modified

438
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,160
UB3A intracestern magagna gene therapy

439
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,000
in Angelman syndrome and more simply

440
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,240
it's just the first gene therapy study

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,480
in Angelman syndrome and it's being run

442
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,240
by Maverick's bio it's being called

443
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,760
ascend angelman syndrome or ascendas

444
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,760
um these are my disclosures I work with

445
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,280
a lot of companies that are developing

446
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
disease targeted therapies for

447
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,520
neurodedevelopmental disorders and any

448
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,000
funding received goes to Rush in support

449
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,840
of our rare disease programs.

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,600
Um so what is the ADN noirus uh gene

451
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
therapy AEV? You've just heard Jim,

452
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,960
you've heard talks on this before. The

453
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,280
AEVS are little viruses not known to

454
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,600
cause disease in people. Um it's been

455
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,520
used in hundred hundreds of clinical

456
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,600
trials and um AAV is one of the most

457
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,400
common vectors that's been used in gene

458
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,280
therapy. Um it's used to carry a gene

459
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,160
that's missing or nonfunctional and put

460
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,840
the right gene back in. And so it's good

461
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,280
at targeting neurons and that's one of

462
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:24,320
the reasons it's been chosen for a lot

463
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,919
of neurological treatments. Um and it

464
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,600
can be administered in various different

465
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,840
ways. And so this just shows you a

466
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,240
cartoon. You've got a defective gene.

467
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,280
You want to put the normal gene in or

468
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:38,000
therapeutic gene in. So you put the gene

469
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,480
into the viral capsid and take out the

470
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,480
replicative machinery of the virus.

471
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Basically it becomes a virus that's like

472
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,039
the hotel California. It can check in

473
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,799
but it can't really get out except for

474
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,039
um the degraded capsids. Um and then we

475
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,880
put the gene therapy into the patient.

476
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,200
It goes to the neuron. It goes in the

477
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,120
neuron. the capsid sort of falls apart

478
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,120
and gets excreted and the gene remains

479
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,360
in the neuron making the protein that's

480
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,160
desired if everything goes perfectly

481
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,919
according to plan. Um so MVX220

482
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,640
is you know what Jim just described.

483
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,640
It's an investigational gene therapy um

484
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,480
replace a gene replacement therapy using

485
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,559
the AAV hue 68 vector um which is

486
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,880
optimized for this particular gene

487
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:26,240
therapy. um it expresses a codon

488
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,640
optimized human ub3A gene under control

489
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,799
of a human synapsin promoter and

490
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,799
synapsin is a protein that's expressed

491
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,679
by neurons. So that just guarantees that

492
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:37,520
the gene will get expressed in neurons.

493
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:42,000
um it's delivered into the CSF for

494
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,720
direct CNS delivery into the magna and

495
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,039
this is done under CT guidance very

496
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,120
carefully with general anesthesia after

497
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,799
a person goes and does the training that

498
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,640
Jim just described at at um UPEN and so

499
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,240
the picture shows you you know we're

500
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,960
have the gene in the virus we give it to

501
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,640
the patient and then theoretically UB3A

502
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,360
gets expressed in the brain

503
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,679
um so the total dose in this particular

504
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,360
study is based on body weight. Many of

505
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,000
the gene therapy studies just use one

506
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,919
empiric dose. Um but it's but we're

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,360
estimating the brain weight based on an

508
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,880
MRI scan. And this total dose is going

509
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
to be lower than what you would have to

510
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
give if you gave the gene therapy IV. I

511
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,039
think Gene Jim showed you really well if

512
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,200
you give it IV, you have to give a lot

513
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,440
more. And that's associated with more

514
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,760
toxicity. you base the dose on body

515
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,320
weight and it's just not the optimal way

516
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,679
to right now to give something to the

517
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,799
central nervous system at least to give

518
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,840
AAV to the central nervous system. Um so

519
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,320
the trial is the first in human trial

520
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,880
for Angelman syndrome with gene therapy.

521
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,640
It's um including adult and pediatric

522
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,360
patients. We're going to deliver it into

523
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,960
the Cernna Magna. It's open label. That

524
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,799
means that everybody is getting the

525
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,400
product. We're not going to do a placebo

526
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,000
with all of the kind of procedure we

527
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,440
have to do. And then the outcome

528
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,440
measures are the outcome measures that

529
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,600
we're using in the ASO trials. They're

530
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,760
come from all the learnings from ABOM

531
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,520
and from the natural history study and

532
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,799
they're based on the domains that were

533
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,400
identified in the um PFDD with FDA that

534
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,200
of things that are important to people

535
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,280
with Angelman syndrome. Um the primary

536
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,080
objective is to evaluate the safety and

537
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,919
tolerability as every first trial that

538
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,400
the primary objective is always to make

539
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,080
sure things are safe um in Angelmen

540
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,080
patients and the key secondary

541
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,200
objectives are to measure the levels of

542
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,679
MBX 220 in blood and CSF as well as to

543
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,120
evaluate the efficacy with all of these

544
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
clinical outcome measures that we're

545
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,280
going to use.

546
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,640
Um the study design basically there's

547
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,400
cohort one which is the adults. Um, so

548
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
these participants are going to be dosed

549
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,799
sequentially. In other words, we give a

550
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,360
dose and then we wait several months and

551
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,360
we have safety followup and then that's

552
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,200
reviewed by a committee that decides,

553
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,600
yes, everything went okay. Now you can

554
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
dose the next patient. And that's really

555
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,400
important because if you do a lot of

556
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,159
patients at once and then there was a

557
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,840
horrible safety event, you would be

558
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,159
doing something horrible to multiple

559
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,640
patients instead of just one. This is

560
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,720
generally how gene therapies are done.

561
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
If all three of the adult patients are

562
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,400
safe, then there'll be a review and we

563
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,000
can start dosing the pediatric patients

564
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,559
which will be four to eight years of

565
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,799
age. Um the participants again are dosed

566
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,799
sequentially and there's a safety review

567
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,440
and a and a independent safety

568
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:27,840
monitoring committee review between each

569
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,679
patient's dosing. Um then there's an

570
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,480
optional cohort where we could add three

571
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,960
more patients um within the total age

572
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,600
range of four to 50.

573
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,039
Um, so what kinds of outcome measures

574
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
are we going to use? We're going to use

575
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,400
the same things that people have been

576
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,480
exposed to in the um in the ASO trials

577
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,000
for communication. We've got the ORCA.

578
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,000
You've heard a lot about the Orca. It's

579
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,280
measuring communication in individuals

580
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,880
with the type of communication

581
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,799
impairments that people with Angelman

582
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,480
syndrome have. Um, and then we're using

583
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,799
standardized measures like the Vineland

584
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,760
and the Bailey. Um, which we have a lot

585
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,000
of natural history data on and the ASA

586
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,080
which is a clinician global impression.

587
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,720
Um, we're measuring cognition with the

588
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,400
Bailey. Um, we're measuring daily life

589
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,760
skills with the Vineland and the um, and

590
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,400
the CGI. We're measuring sleep with a

591
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,360
sleep diary and the CGI. We're measuring

592
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,559
gross motor with the Bailey and the

593
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,120
Vineland. And we have a side device that

594
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,600
we can look at how the patient walks. Um

595
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,279
and then behavior with behavior scales,

596
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,320
fine motor again with the Bailey and

597
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,320
Vineland um and the CGI. And then we

598
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,480
have a QI disability scale that looks at

599
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,320
what your quality of life is after the

600
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,400
gene therapy is administered and what

601
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,840
the patient's quality of life is. Um and

602
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,240
then we have a quite a number of

603
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,120
biomarkers based on EEG um CSF levels of

604
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,039
in in in both levels in both blood and

605
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:59,360
body fluids as well as MRI scans.

606
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,159
Um the key eligibility criteria um are

607
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,640
um 18 to 50 years right now for the

608
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:07,919
adult cohort and then eventually um two

609
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,080
to eight years. Um you can have UPD or

610
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,159
ICD. Patients with mutations have been

611
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,960
excluded because they're this is a small

612
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,360
study and they're much more variable. Um

613
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,120
the ability to ambulate independently is

614
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,679
required so that we can assess nerve

615
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,960
function in the lower legs after we give

616
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,640
um after we give the therapy. Um stable

617
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,480
your your seizure drugs have to be

618
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,200
stable and then you have to be on a

619
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,720
stable diet i.e like the ketogenic or

620
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,960
LGIT diet. Um exclusion is other

621
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,960
clinically important medical challenges,

622
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,120
laboratory ab abnormalities that would

623
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,440
preclude you from participating in a

624
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,600
gene therapy trial. Um serious

625
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,520
infections. You can't have an infection

626
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,880
within the six weeks prior to giving

627
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,640
gene therapy. You can't have

628
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,159
immunizations right before a gene

629
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,760
therapy because those activate the

630
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,120
immune system and we don't want to

631
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,760
activate the immune system. Um history

632
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,520
of autoimmune diseases. Um treatment

633
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,120
with an ASO. you can be treated with

634
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,559
this ASO, but your last treatment has to

635
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,039
be over a year ago. Um, and if you can't

636
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,640
meet the MRI or the dosing requirements,

637
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,240
or if it would be unsafe to give you

638
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
steroids, which we have to use to

639
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,919
suppress the immune system, then um,

640
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,520
then we would have to exclude the

641
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,520
patient.

642
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,960
Um, so here's the study design. The

643
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,520
patients come in, they do a whole bunch

644
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,080
of tests. Um, just like with every other

645
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,320
study, we determine are you meeting all

646
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,000
the eligibility criteria. Then we have a

647
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,320
dosing day where you come in and get

648
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:36,400
dosing and um then post-dosing it's very

649
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,039
intensive because we are monitoring to

650
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,080
make sure that you do not the patient

651
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,840
does not have any kind of hyperimmune

652
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,799
response which is the biggest one of the

653
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,640
biggest dangers of of giving AAV based

654
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,640
gene therapy. We don't think that's

655
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,480
likely in this case because the doses

656
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,640
we're using are not as high as the doses

657
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,200
that have caused problems like that. But

658
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,120
we have to monitor it very closely. So,

659
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,679
you're admitted to the hospital days one

660
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,480
to three after the therapy. Um, we do

661
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,039
labs every day the first seven days. We

662
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,960
check you. We do exams. We make sure

663
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,480
your liver isn't changing size. You

664
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,400
know, all of these things have to be

665
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,159
monitored very closely because the

666
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,799
biggest risk is obviously right after

667
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,200
the gene delivery. And then after we get

668
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,039
past the risk phase, we have assessments

669
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,240
that patients come in regularly to

670
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,080
monitor safety and um eventually, you

671
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,760
know, over the long term to monitor

672
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,000
efficacy and what is the patient doing

673
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,480
and are they doing new things that they

674
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,720
hadn't done before. Um and that's really

675
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,279
the big question is how well will this

676
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,279
work in people?

677
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,400
Um so there are specific risks. Um all

678
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,000
gene therapies carry risks um and both

679
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,720
of both for both short and long-term

680
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,679
effects. Um and so we like to have the

681
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,919
families understand these risks. Um

682
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,679
different viral carrier or different

683
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,039
virus carriers have different kinds of

684
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,000
risks and different doses have maybe um

685
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,159
different kinds of risks. So um we're

686
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,279
going to be looking very carefully at

687
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,440
problems from the ICM procedure itself.

688
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,679
Patients are monitored very carefully in

689
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
anesthesia. They have to have a tube put

690
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,480
in to breathe for them because we're

691
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,640
going to put their head down and we're

692
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,480
going to flex the neck so that we can

693
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,720
get to where we need to get to put the

694
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,720
gene therapy. So careful anesthesia

695
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,399
monitoring. The procedure is only done

696
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,559
by people who have been trained on the

697
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,360
procedure. I personally was able to

698
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,120
experience the training at UPEN. Um and

699
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,039
you really get to try doing the

700
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,799
procedure on cadaavvers and have all

701
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,200
your questions answered. And then for

702
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,200
the first procedure at your site, Dr.

703
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
actually comes and make sure everything

704
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,159
goes okay. So, this was the process that

705
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,640
we did to try to make things absolutely

706
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
safe and we had the CT imaging going on

707
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,480
the whole time that we were doing the

708
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,880
the procedure to make sure the needle

709
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,880
was in exactly the right place. Um, we

710
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
use steroids to suppress the immune

711
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,559
system and there can be side effects

712
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,919
from that. Why do we use the steroids?

713
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,240
Because we don't want the immune system

714
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,320
to actually attack the virus and destroy

715
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
all of our gene therapy. So we have to

716
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,720
try to get the immune system kind of

717
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,799
pushed, you know, kind of dampened down.

718
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,559
And so we're using steroids to do that.

719
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,720
But there obviously are side effects of

720
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,320
steroids that patients can have like

721
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,960
getting infections, but also like

722
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:22,000
increasing reflux and various other

723
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,559
sleep problems, increased appetite, but

724
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,440
this is transient. So um we we just

725
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,159
manage it symptomatically as as as you

726
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,039
know as we use the steroids. um immune

727
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,520
responses in the organs or in the blood

728
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:38,000
cells. We have to we we we eliminate

729
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,159
patients who have problems with um who

730
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,840
have immunological challenges and we

731
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,720
have careful monitoring throughout the

732
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,159
study of all of these parameters. Blood

733
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,279
tests that reflect the heart, the

734
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,159
kidney, um your immune system. Um and

735
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,120
then the the steroids help, but then we

736
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,679
can also extend the steroid use if we

737
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,760
have a problem with an immune reaction.

738
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,840
um liver toxicity. We watch very closely

739
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,000
for that. We just watch labs for that.

740
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,240
And then you can get a the virus can go

741
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,080
into the sensory nerves, the dorsal root

742
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,799
ganglia, which is in the back of the

743
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,440
spinal cord and controls um your sensory

744
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,080
nerves. And so we carefully monitor for

745
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,720
that as well. Um most of that is

746
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:23,760
reversible, but we um but but we have to

747
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:26,559
watch it closely. Um so um the then then

748
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,960
there's the uncertainty of you know of

749
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,520
for instance how long how well will the

750
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,279
the well will the gene therapy work and

751
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,200
over what time will it work? Will we see

752
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,760
gradual building over five years or will

753
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,840
we see a bump and then not much other

754
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,760
change? How much will change? And that's

755
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,440
a question that we are going to answer

756
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,080
through these studies. We have no way of

757
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,039
answering that question perfectly for

758
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,520
humans with an animal model.

759
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,360
Um so this is just the first patient was

760
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,480
treated. Um and so that red arrow is

761
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,440
pointing to the sternum magna on the MRI

762
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,320
scan of the patient. What what we like

763
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,640
to see is a nice triangular space there

764
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,640
where we can get the needle in but not

765
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,159
hit anything else. And we map very

766
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,679
closely where the blood vessels are

767
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,080
because we don't want to hit a blood

768
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,159
vessel back there. That's not good. Um

769
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,120
and then the middle picture is me

770
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,840
administering the gene therapy. And um

771
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,360
you can see from the um from the picture

772
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,000
on the far right, oh no, the picture on

773
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,919
the left that um the need the little

774
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,520
sticky kind of thing you see pointing in

775
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,760
there is the needle and it's sitting

776
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,679
right there in the magna where we want

777
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,919
to give the gene therapy. So that's a

778
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,279
little view of what it looks like. Um

779
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,240
there are currently two sites open,

780
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,080
Russia and UPEN. Um, UPUPEN was not yet

781
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,840
yet recruiting the last I heard, but

782
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,279
they're posted on clinical trials.gov,

783
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,559
but they're they're looking at patients

784
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,840
and they'll be up and running soon. Um,

785
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,760
and so in conclusion, MBX220 was solely

786
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,480
funded through the efforts of FAST in

787
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,720
collaboration with Jim at Penn from

788
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,120
proof of concept through IND enabling

789
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,880
studies. Fast works with ABOM to try to

790
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,640
develop the regulatory framework and

791
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,840
clinically meaningful endpoints that we

792
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,080
can use that the FDA will buy into um in

793
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,679
in trials. Um MVX AAV1 is the first

794
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,679
clinical trial for a single treatment

795
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,159
gene replacement for Angelman syndrome.

796
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,720
The first patient has been treated and

797
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:25,279
is thus far doing well. The study is

798
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,440
underway. Um a clinical trial

799
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,039
application for MVX220 was approved by

800
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
Health Canada. So, we will be

801
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,519
potentially recruiting patients in

802
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,440
Canada for the pediatric cohort. And

803
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,600
again, you can go to clinicaltrials.gov

804
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,679
and see the sites that are running the

805
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,200
trial at any given time that are open to

806
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,480
do the trial. Um, and I want to thank

807
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,840
the Rush team. Back there somewhere is

808
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,519
Milana and Allison who's our regulatory

809
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,600
coordinator who got this whole thing in

810
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,640
record speed through the IBC, the

811
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,960
biologicals committee, and the IRB. um

812
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,120
Milana who did everything for the trial

813
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,279
and really helped make this happen and

814
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,600
Melissa who managed our budget and

815
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,840
contracts people and got this going so

816
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,120
that we could be open and you know have

817
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,880
have a patient dosed by this meeting. Um

818
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,480
and then we have a variety of other

819
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,840
people that work on the trial, our

820
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,760
coordinators, our medical people. Um and

821
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,279
then this does not happen without

822
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,360
basically a village. So you have the

823
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,519
rush pharmacy, anesthesia,

824
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,200
neuroraiology, the pediatrics ICU where

825
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,600
the patient goes after the procedure.

826
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,880
And we all really worked in concert, you

827
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,279
know, to make this happen. And then

828
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,200
Brian, he came in, he he did the

829
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,960
training. He came in, he helped us out

830
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,640
through our first one because this

831
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,279
procedure had never been done at Rush

832
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,720
before. So, um, we had him there to make

833
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,799
sure everything went smoothly, helped

834
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,279
train our neuroraiologists.

835
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,840
Um, and so that was great. And then our

836
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,159
brave patient and family. I it what is

837
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:58,120
it like to be the first person that does

838
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,120
this? They they are the pioneer

839
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,159
and then all the different participants

840
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,440
in making this process happen as well as

841
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,159
Sophia Loose who is my second grandchild

842
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,839
that fortunately decided to come out

843
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,599
three weeks early so that I could be

844
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:18,560
there for her delivery rather than being

845
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,399
at this meeting during her delivery.

846
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,560
Um, so all of that and then we thank the

847
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,839
community for supporting all of the work

848
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,280
that leads up to this. And so that's all

849
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm going to say. I think we're over

850
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,280
time.
