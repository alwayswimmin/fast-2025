1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
Our next speaker is Dr. Kim Goodspeed,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,480
who I introduced yesterday, so I don't

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,240
think she needs another introduction.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,639
She's going to be talking to us about

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,639
GTX 102, what we've learned together.

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,639
Kim,

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,920
uh, hello everybody. Um, thanks so much,

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,840
uh, for the opportunity to be here today

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,279
again. Um, so for those of you I didn't

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,119
get to meet yesterday, I'm Kim

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,039
Goodspeed. I'm a child neurologist uh by

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
training been with ultragenics for a bit

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,719
now and I get to have the distinct honor

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,360
and pleasure of being the clinical

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,160
development lead for our GTX 102 program

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,840
and of course GTX 102 is our anti-sense

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,079
nucleotide ASO for Angelmen syndrome. Um

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,239
before we dive too deeply though I did

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,879
want to say thank you again. Um so thank

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,760
you to FAST for letting us come be part

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,440
of the programming here this uh this

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,079
summit. It's been an amazing summit.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,600
lots of exciting science happening. Um,

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,760
thank you to those of you out there

25
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,280
listening and interested to learn more

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
and dive into stuff that's really

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
complicated. Um, we really appreciate

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,920
all of your questions and your feedback.

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,520
Thanks to our participants and families

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
who have trusted us to go on the journey

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
with us and been part of our trials to

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,159
date and um to those study teams out

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,240
there who are making all of the magic

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
happen at the study sites so that we can

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,680
actually do the studies, answer the

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
questions and move things forward. So,

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,880
thank you everybody. So, uh,

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
disclaimers, of course, GTX 102 is an

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
investigational drug and I'm presenting

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,400
open label interim data. So, we're going

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,159
to share some data from our phase one

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,840
two study. You've seen this before, but

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,119
we're thinking about it in a slightly

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,640
different way and getting to dig deeper

45
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,079
into the methodology. For those of you

46
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,320
who were here yesterday, some of the

47
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,840
slides are repeated. Um, but my

48
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
grandmother was an elementary school

49
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,600
teacher and I think I learned from her

50
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
that it's really important to hammer

51
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,640
home messages and repeat things that are

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,720
important. So, we're going to go through

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
those slides again. Um and of course I'm

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,520
an employee of ultragenics.

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,280
So who is ultragenics? Um all we do is

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,960
rare. We do rare and ultra rare

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,640
diseases. And um we were founded in 2010

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,680
by Amal Kakis and he saw a problem. He

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,239
was working on MPS1 mopacyosis type one

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
at the time and saw that it was really

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,680
hard to do drug development for rare

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
diseases and he thought he could make a

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,800
difference. So he's now built out a team

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,280
of 1300 employees. Uh we're based out of

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,440
Nevada in Northern California, but I

66
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,920
live in Texas. We've got people all over

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,480
the globe that are working to help bring

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,200
new drugs to uh disorders that don't

69
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,519
have treatments right now.

70
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,840
And this is GTX 102. So we'll just spend

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,840
a tiny bit of time here. Um I think this

72
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,879
audience knows what ASOs are by this

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,200
point, but um GTX 102's job is to bind

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,840
to the anti-sense transcript and allow

75
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,920
for expression of the paternal al. So it

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,720
does that by binding to that transcript

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,599
causing it to be degraded. That opens up

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,080
the paternal alil for expression so that

79
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,200
you get to use that backup copy from dad

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,080
to make UB3A protein.

81
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,400
We um have looked at a lot of different

82
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
outcome measures and see that we're

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,159
seeing some improvements across some of

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
the core symptoms of Angelman syndrome

85
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,319
and we've had a generally pretty good

86
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,760
safety profile. So, here's some of the

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,080
most common safety events that we've

88
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
seen in our phrase one two trial. We do

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,840
have a safety event that we monitor

90
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,920
closely. Um, it's an adverse event of

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,080
special interest or AESI or you may have

92
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
heard the term ridiculopathy in some of

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
our other presentations. What that

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,000
essentially means is that we've had a

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,760
few kids who have had some sensory

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
changes or some motor changes that have

97
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,440
impacted how they were able to walk for

98
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,519
a short period of time. They all

99
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,480
recovered completely. nobody had any

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,720
long-lasting impact and we're able to go

101
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,239
back on drug and have improvements uh

102
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,239
without having any recurrence of this

103
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
event. So, it's an important event. It's

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,360
an event that we monitor for, but we

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360
know how to monitor for it. We know how

106
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,720
to identify it. We know how to treat it.

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,400
And most importantly, we know how to get

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,159
kids back on drugs so that they can

109
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,680
continue to receive potential benefits

110
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,159
from GTX 102. So the way we've

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,560
structured this talk today is we're in a

112
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,080
nice interesting time in our program

113
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
where our phase three study is running

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
right now and so we've got a little bit

115
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,880
of time to reflect a tiny bit of time I

116
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,639
think. But we were thinking about all of

117
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,160
the lessons we've learned from you as a

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,560
community and how much you've made our

119
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,320
program better. So lesson number one was

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,240
measure what matters. And so y'all are

121
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,320
the experts on Angelmen. you know what

122
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
it's like to live in your household with

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,440
your loved ones that have Angelman

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,240
syndrome and the daily challenges that

125
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,000
you face and it's our job and my team's

126
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,320
job to figure out how do we turn those

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,360
daily challenges into things we can

128
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,919
measure as clinical outcome measures. So

129
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,280
one of the ways we've done that is by

130
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,639
learning from your natural history

131
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,720
studies, learning from your disease

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
concept studies, and then also learning

133
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,120
from our own data. So, we can look at

134
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,160
our baseline data and we've got a poster

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,919
up that um summarizes all of this. But

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,800
what I thought was really exciting and

137
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,680
our team was excited about was that this

138
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,240
data really reflects that we're able to

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,560
measure and quantify the symptoms that

140
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,960
you've told us matter. And what that

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,800
means is that we're able to put a number

142
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,479
to it and that's a number that we can

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,988
follow over the course of a clinical

144
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,120
trial and see if it changes.

145
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:21,919
>> [snorts]

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,360
>> And so these data highlight the

147
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,680
importance of capturing those symptoms.

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,440
We capture them in a quantifiable way

149
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
through those surveys, the Bailey data,

150
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
Vineland data, all of these things, but

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
we also get to have qualitative data

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,199
from our caregivers that are

153
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
participating in the trial. So we do

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,919
qualitative interviews at study entry

155
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
and periodically throughout our studies

156
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,560
with a subset of um participants, subset

157
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
of caregivers, and they tell us what all

158
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,720
of this stuff means. What is it like to

159
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,560
be in the trial? What is it like to live

160
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,800
um with your loved one that has Angelmen

161
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,479
syndrome? What is it like uh when you

162
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,479
say behavior problem? What does that

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,720
mean? And then we can link that data

164
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,120
with our quantitative data and give it

165
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,960
some more color and meaning.

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
But one of the ways we also like to look

167
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,240
at our data is with the multi-dommain

168
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
responder index. So again, we've got a

169
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,560
cool poster that I'll flag and you can

170
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,664
go talk to us about it. Um, and we

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
learned from the PFGD, excuse me,

172
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:17,360
[clears throat]

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,039
we learned from the PFTD that sleep and

174
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
behavior are also super important in

175
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
addition to cognition and communication

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,720
and seizures and all of the other things

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,360
you face. And so we got to collaborate

178
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,720
with FAST and and were asked to look at

179
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
our behavior data and it was a really

180
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,039
cool opportunity to say look our

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,800
behavior data is capturing the symptoms

182
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,440
of hyperactivity, non-compliance,

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,759
impulsivity that are really challenging

184
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,120
in the home and we see it changing in

185
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,759
response to GTX 102. So now we know that

186
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,840
we've got some pieces that we get to go

187
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,240
after look at even more depth in our

188
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,960
phase three study. But that's just one

189
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,039
piece of the puzzle, right? And so the

190
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,520
way that we like to look at our data is

191
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,919
in all of the symptoms at one time and

192
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,919
see how things change. And that's

193
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,720
because a single primary efficacy

194
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,280
endpoint may not be good enough to

195
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,759
measure all of the ways these drugs can

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,160
impact patients.

197
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,240
The way that drugs are typically

198
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,039
designed in clinical trials to be tested

199
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,599
is you pick one symptom that's linked

200
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,919
with one s uh one uh clinical outcome

201
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,400
assessment and you need to see change in

202
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,160
that one particular measure. That means

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,319
that everybody that enters the trial

204
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,919
probably needs to have that symptom. For

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
some disorders, that may be okay. For

206
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,199
some symptoms, that may be okay. But

207
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
what if you're missing other potential

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
benefits?

209
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
or what if you're having to exclude

210
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,000
participants who could benefit in other

211
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
ways and they're not getting to be in

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,280
that trial and we don't get to learn

213
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,880
about their experience too in other

214
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
symptoms.

215
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,280
We also know that many drugs impact

216
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
patients differently. One drug may treat

217
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,400
two different symptoms and isn't it

218
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,639
important to know about that and be able

219
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,000
to, you know, put significant weight

220
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,599
behind that? And for that matter, we've

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
heard all the exciting stuff about the

222
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,440
ASOS, the crispers, the gene therapies

223
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,759
this morning. These are all targeting

224
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,240
the underlying symptom or the underlying

225
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
cause of Angelmen syndrome and we know

226
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,400
that your kids are not all the same.

227
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,479
Yes, there's a group of symptoms that

228
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,160
we're expecting to see, but we don't see

229
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,440
every single symptom in every single

230
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,199
person in the exact same way. So, the

231
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,400
multi-dommain responder index or the

232
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,720
MDRI is one of our solutions to be able

233
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,120
to capture and assess this change across

234
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,959
multiple symptoms using one analytical

235
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,680
tool. So, what is it? It's a statistical

236
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:40,240
analytical tool. It's a methodology that

237
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,919
we apply to our data. So, we assign

238
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
clinical domains that are meaningful

239
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,040
based on the patient population we're

240
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,880
studying and then we assign um clinical

241
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,640
thresholds to those and see what our

242
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,160
responder analysis looks like. We'll go

243
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,519
into that in a little more detail in a

244
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,680
second.

245
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,920
If you've heard of composite endpoints,

246
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,080
that is another way to pull in multiple

247
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,399
clinical endpoints into one analytical

248
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,600
tool, but it's a little bit different.

249
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,360
In the MDRI, each of the domains is

250
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,839
independent. We're measuring it

251
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,480
individually. And in this case, they're

252
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,000
all symptoms of Angelman syndrome, but

253
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,000
for a composite endpoint, you typically

254
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,920
need it to be a single symptom that

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,760
you're measuring in different ways. And

256
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,800
all of those outcome measures are

257
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,959
pointing to that one symptom. So

258
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
different ways to measure one versus

259
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,040
different symptoms being measured at the

260
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,320
same time.

261
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,160
So we do it by identifying four to six

262
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,680
different clinically important domains.

263
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,240
They need to be important and

264
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,000
independent. Then we assign a clinical

265
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
endpoint to each of those domains or

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,040
each of those symptoms a way to measure

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
for change. Then we define the minimal

268
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,640
excuse me the meaningful score

269
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,080
difference. Uh it used to be called a

270
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
minimal important difference. There's

271
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
been a lot of different terms for this.

272
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,279
What it's essentially saying is a

273
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,080
clinical threshold.

274
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,839
Beyond this score is good. Below or

275
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,160
beyond this score in that direction is

276
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,000
bad. Um so if you meet or surpass the

277
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,519
clinically meaningful threshold in the

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,880
direction of improvement for the scale

279
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,480
because remember some scales go up and

280
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,040
some scales go down for positive or

281
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,640
negative. If you meet or surpass in the

282
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,560
direction of improvement that means that

283
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,760
we give you a green box and you're a

284
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,279
plus one and we say you had improvement.

285
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,680
meet or surpass in the direction of

286
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,240
worsening. We give it a pink box, you

287
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,720
get a minus one point and we say that

288
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,399
was a case that worsened.

289
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,160
If it falls somewhere in the middle in

290
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,240
the gray zone, we say that's an unclear

291
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,880
treatment effect. We leave the box white

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,720
and we give it a score of zero. You

293
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
tally up the scores for each

294
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,920
participant. So in this hypothetical uh

295
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,920
dummy data here, you've got two domains

296
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,000
that improve, one domain that worsened,

297
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,720
two domains that were unclear, you get a

298
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,399
net response of plus one. Then we apply

299
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
statistical methodologies to that,

300
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,399
statistical testing to the group and

301
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:01,440
understand um if we have statistically

302
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:04,560
significant changes or not. So how did

303
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,959
we build an MDRI for Angelman syndrome?

304
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,680
We started with our domains. Again, we

305
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,279
learned these from you. The uh disease

306
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,800
concept studies, the natural history

307
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,360
studies tell us that these are the

308
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,000
symptoms that don't have good clinical

309
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,360
um uh medical medical treatment options

310
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,560
right now. We assigned a clinical

311
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,560
endpoint to each of these domains. So

312
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,200
based on our one phase one two data,

313
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,480
we're able to learn, okay, we can

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
measure sleep in a bunch of different

315
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
ways, but which one is the best? which

316
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,640
one do we think is capturing what the

317
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,200
patient community tells us is important

318
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,000
and which one is also responding to

319
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,160
treatment. So we see change scores over

320
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,680
time. And so that's how we picked each

321
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,480
of these endpoints was based on our

322
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,640
phase one two data. Then we get to

323
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,880
define the um MSDS. So the meaningful

324
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,200
score difference for each of these. And

325
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,160
again we use our phase one two data to

326
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,480
help us understand um what is the

327
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,920
threshold that we need to say if you're

328
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,040
beyond this score it's an improvement.

329
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,279
If you're beyond this score it's a

330
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,040
worsening. So let's walk through a

331
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,240
couple of examples and then I'll show

332
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,720
you the entire um table.

333
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,040
So first a relatively simple one. So we

334
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,399
have participant one here. They got

335
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,399
better in every single one of these

336
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,000
domains. So they met or surpassed in the

337
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,399
direction of clinical improvement on

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,079
each domain. That means we color the box

339
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
green and we give it a plus one. So they

340
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,440
have a total net response score of plus

341
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,079
five. That's the max score we could get

342
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,639
on this

343
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,200
subject two which is technic subject 11.

344
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,800
our second example. Um, so this one's a

345
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,639
little bit more complicated. We've got

346
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,320
three domains that improve, two that

347
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,160
stayed essentially the same, had an

348
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,200
unclear treatment effect, so they get a

349
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,720
net response of plus three.

350
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,399
The last one, so um, this one has two

351
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,639
domains that worsened this time. So we

352
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,680
color those boxes pink, so they're a

353
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,120
minus one point. Two boxes are green,

354
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,800
that means they surpassed the threshold

355
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
in the improvement direction. So they

356
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,680
get plus one for each of those. and they

357
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,680
had one that was an unclear treatment

358
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,320
effect. Add those all up and you get a

359
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,200
net score of zero. Okay, so that's how

360
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,440
we walk through each participant.

361
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,440
Now, the whole big data. So, this is all

362
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,440
of our participants from cohorts A and

363
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
B. So, just two of our groups that were

364
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,040
in our phase one two study. We're

365
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,959
assessing them at baseline and at day

366
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,120
338, which is approximately one year

367
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,120
into treatment. And we see how did their

368
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,320
score change over the course of that one

369
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,480
year. Did the score meet or surpass the

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,079
direction the score differential for the

371
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,480
direction in improvement or for

372
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,200
worsening? Um, and so if it's improved,

373
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,079
we get a green box, worsened, pink box,

374
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,839
no change, white box. Add them all up

375
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,680
for each participant and then you get

376
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
that final column there, which is the

377
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,480
total net response.

378
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,839
And you can see the total net responses

379
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,800
in green. tally up to 22 out of 28 of

380
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,959
these kids, which is 79% of kids with at

381
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,519
least one domain that has a net

382
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,279
responsive clinical improvement. You can

383
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,519
see that some kids improve in some

384
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,160
places, don't change in some places, and

385
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,079
even worsen in some places. Um, but it

386
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
gives you a sense that everybody's

387
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,560
responding in different ways, and we get

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,279
to look at that data in this kind of

389
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,839
bird's eye view of the totality all at

390
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,079
one time. Now, of course, we look at

391
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,760
each of these individually as well um in

392
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,240
the more traditional way of looking at

393
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,000
our line graphs and our um bar graphs

394
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,279
that we show you all the time, but we

395
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,360
think that this is a really nice

396
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,839
snapshot that gives you a sense that a

397
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,040
lot of kids are improving.

398
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:41,040
Okay, so lesson two, uh patient focused

399
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,959
study design. Um I think one of our core

400
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,440
tenants at Ultragenics is that we do

401
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,240
patient focused drug development. We get

402
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,000
your input all all along the way and in

403
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,360
fact you have given us a lot of feedback

404
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,760
and input over time. So we have more

405
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,079
formal less formal interactions with you

406
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,040
and we appreciate that feedback always.

407
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,120
We do our best to hear you to listen and

408
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,040
to make changes to the best of our

409
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,199
abilities. [snorts] Um so thank you for

410
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,000
the feedback and um know that we'll

411
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,399
continue to keep asking.

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,040
Um, one of the ways that I'd like to

413
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,360
highlight that we did um, receive

414
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,800
feedback and made some changes um, was

415
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
how we thought about our phase three

416
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,720
study. So to walk you through a little

417
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
bit, how do you design a controlled

418
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
clinical study? Traditional ways of

419
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,519
placeboc controlled um, study. So you

420
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,160
have a placebo group that receives a

421
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,000
medicine that is essentially like a fake

422
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
medicine. It's it's a medicine that

423
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,560
looks and is administered and given

424
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,560
exactly like the treatment drug with

425
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,399
active treatment. But the placebo

426
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,120
doesn't have any active ingredients in

427
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,440
it. Um

428
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,199
in rare disease it's tricky though. We

429
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,480
have to be creative, right? We have

430
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:54,720
small patient populations. Um your kids

431
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,120
are also vulnerable and we need to

432
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,320
protect them and think about what do we

433
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,800
absolutely need to do um to answer our

434
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,519
scientific questions.

435
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,440
We also had feedback from the EMA that

436
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
came from those of you in the audience

437
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,000
who are our European colleagues and

438
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,600
families. Um, you got to give some

439
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,600
feedback to the EMA and they summarize

440
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,199
that in a survey and we heard you loud

441
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,639
and clear that sham controlled was

442
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,440
preferred. So what's a sham study?

443
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,160
So a sham control means that you don't

444
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,240
actually give any medicine or fake

445
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,920
medicine. it means you do a procedure

446
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,320
and you make it look like you're giving

447
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,720
the medicine without that final step of

448
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,639
administering anything.

449
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,120
So that's the study design that we

450
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,639
carried into Aspire, our phase three

451
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:46,320
clinical study um which of course we got

452
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,440
feedback from you on. So our phase three

453
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,639
study Aspire is our global study. We got

454
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,680
to enroll 129 kids and kudos to you in

455
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,120
the audience and all of our

456
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,680
investigators that worked with us on

457
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,880
this. We enrolled this study very

458
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,639
quickly um and by July this summer we

459
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,360
were completed for enrollment and now

460
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,720
that data just gets to cook like a sule.

461
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,959
We're not touching it until it's ready

462
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,880
to be looked at. And so um it's studying

463
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,079
the same population that we studied in

464
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,039
our phase one two study uh patients four

465
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,880
to 17 deletion genotype and we're

466
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,520
looking at the same similar outcome

467
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,919
measures that we looked at there.

468
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,240
It's a sham control design again, but it

469
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,840
is double blind. So that means that

470
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,919
everybody goes through a screening and

471
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,720
randomization period and then you're

472
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,799
randomly assigned one to one, so a 50-50

473
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,720
chance to either get treatment in the

474
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,200
double blind period or to go into that

475
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,000
sham control uh where you are getting a

476
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,520
sham procedure completed at every visit.

477
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,919
And for some of those visits, we're

478
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,440
doing a full lumbar puncture to pull off

479
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,360
a little bit of spinal fluid so we can

480
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,080
do some analyses, understand some more

481
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,679
safety profiles, and also continue to

482
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,840
work on biomarkers because they're so

483
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,679
important.

484
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,799
So the first year of the study is double

485
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,679
blind. That means that most of the study

486
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,000
site uh a group at the study site are

487
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,600
blinded and don't know whether the

488
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,080
participant is getting drug or is

489
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,480
getting the sham. The caregivers don't

490
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,840
know, the participants don't know. There

491
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,760
are some study site staff that do have

492
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,280
to know because right it something

493
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,440
different happens in the procedure room

494
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,039
for each of these kids. And so they need

495
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,120
to know if they're giving drug or if

496
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,880
they're doing the sham.

497
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,799
But in the open label period in year

498
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,559
two, everybody receives drug. So the uh

499
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,320
treatment period, the treatment arm gets

500
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,039
to just continue receiving their drug in

501
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,080
the maintenance period. the sham control

502
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,919
arm will transition over to drug um in

503
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,160
that open label year and go through the

504
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,120
same dosing regimen as um all of the

505
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,760
other participants have.

506
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,760
Okay, lesson three, inclusion of all

507
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,080
genotypes is important. Uh we've heard

508
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,400
you multiple times. We also agree GTX

509
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,919
102 was designed to treat Angelman

510
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,320
syndrome. It was designed to restore

511
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,559
UB3A production regardless of the

512
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,080
underlying genotype, regardless of age.

513
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,760
And so we need to look at the safety and

514
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,520
efficacy in these other populations that

515
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,039
we haven't had the opportunity to study

516
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
yet.

517
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,840
So as a broad overview of clinical

518
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,840
trials and the phases and how they kind

519
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,840
of work, this isn't meant to be a linear

520
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,360
timeline, but you march through

521
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,480
typically phase one, phase two, and

522
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,880
phase three. And they each have

523
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,559
different goals. So your phase one and

524
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,480
phase two studies are your safety

525
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,039
studies. In rare disease, we always look

526
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,840
at efficacy, too, but they're your

527
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,840
safety studies. that study enrolled or

528
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,760
completed enrollment uh quite some time

529
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,679
ago at this point and so those kids are

530
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
continuing to receive drug in our uh

531
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,000
long-term extension study. Um and we get

532
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,799
to continue to learn about the long-term

533
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,559
effects of GTX 102.

534
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,080
Phase three studies are your pivotal,

535
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,039
your controlled studies that are really

536
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,039
meant to truly assess benefit risk. Is

537
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,240
it working and is it safe? And you

538
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,840
typically control them through that

539
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,080
blinding mechanism like we just talked

540
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,600
about. Enrollment completed for this

541
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
study over the summer. We're just

542
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,320
waiting for the data now, but we're here

543
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,919
now. So, phase two studies, again, we

544
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,960
get to do safety studies. Remember, we

545
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
needed to look at the safety and

546
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,120
efficacy in our other populations. And

547
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,200
so, this study actually opened for

548
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,679
enrollment in October. And we're really

549
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,799
excited. If you want more information,

550
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,320
thank you.

551
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,160
Um,

552
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,919
thank you. We're super excited. We're

553
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,360
very proud of the team. Appreciative

554
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,360
again to the investigators who go on

555
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,400
this journey with us and go really fast.

556
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,760
Um, we are so excited to have this study

557
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,080
going and can't wait to see what this

558
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,480
data looks like.

559
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,080
So, looking at them one more time, phase

560
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,159
one, two study was our safety study. It

561
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,880
was the initial study, kids ages 4 to

562
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
17, deletion genotype really helped us

563
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,799
design the rest of the studies going

564
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,559
forward. Our long-term extension is

565
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,640
where we get to see that long-term

566
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,159
benefit, the long-term safety profile

567
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,320
when kids are on maintenance uh,

568
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,799
therapy. And this is the study where

569
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,640
kids will always land um from their

570
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,880
parent study. So from the initial study

571
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
they enroll in. Phase three is the

572
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,200
Aspire study. It's our pivotal

573
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
well-controlled study um and it finished

574
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
enrollment this summer. And Aurora is

575
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,880
our phase two study look at safety and

576
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,320
efficacy in um the additional

577
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,240
populations we haven't gotten to study

578
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,480
yet. And all of this information can be

579
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,080
found in much greater detail at ct.gov.

580
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,360
Um, so I encourage everybody to get

581
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,840
familiar with that website if you

582
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,320
haven't already and just try to digest

583
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,960
the government website as best you can.

584
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,799
Um, so what is Aurora?

585
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,760
It is a global study. We're enrolling

586
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:36,000
approximately 60 children and adults and

587
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,960
it's going to be a phase 2 basket design

588
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,520
study. That means that we get to include

589
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,240
different subgroups and study them under

590
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,480
one clinical protocol. We're looking at

591
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,000
all the same kinds of symptoms, but it

592
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,080
may be slightly different to look at

593
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,919
behavior in adults versus behavior in

594
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,600
younger kids. And so we've thought

595
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,520
through all of those details and tried

596
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
to pick the right outcome measures to

597
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,880
measure these symptoms in each of these

598
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,200
populations.

599
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,679
So group A is going to be deletion

600
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,200
genotype and these kids will be ages one

601
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,520
to three.

602
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Uh, group B is going to be our UPD and

603
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,080
ICD kits, and they're going to be the

604
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,919
same ages, 4 to 17, as our other study

605
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,000
populations.

606
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,440
Group C is our adult group. And we're

607
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,360
kind of being more flexible with this

608
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,679
group and accepting any genotype into

609
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,039
it. And then group D is our mutation

610
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,799
type um genotype group. And those again

611
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:32,320
are 4 to 17 years old.

612
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:34,480
And so our groups A, B, and C are going

613
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,960
to do a straight open label one-year

614
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,320
study design. So it is open label,

615
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,480
meaning everybody's on drug and

616
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,440
everybody knows everybody's on drug. You

617
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,159
go through your screening and

618
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:48,000
randomization and then they get treated.

619
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,240
We assess safety. We assess um efficacy

620
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,440
endpoints along the way and then

621
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,919
eventually they get to roll in the

622
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,880
long-term extension study. and then

623
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,240
group D because we have learned that

624
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,600
there can be a little bit more

625
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,880
variability in the um developmental

626
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,880
severity of this group. We understand

627
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,120
that neurodedevelopmental disabilities

628
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,280
is ubiquitous. Everybody with Angelman

629
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
syndrome has significant u

630
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,960
neurodedevelopmental disability. But

631
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,760
this group is the group that has just a

632
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,559
slightly bigger variation in that level

633
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,240
of severity between individuals. So for

634
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,679
that reason, we've included a no

635
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:28,799
treatment control period in this study.

636
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,080
So what will happen is kids will uh

637
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:34,080
either for excuse me, every two kids

638
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
that go into the treatment open label

639
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,880
one-year arm, one child will go into

640
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,720
that no treatment control period and

641
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,320
then start treatment after about six

642
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,280
months. So it's a 2:1 randomization.

643
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,320
It's still open label. It's still not

644
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,039
blinded. It's still not sham. It's not

645
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,200
placebo. Everybody will get treatment.

646
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
We're just asking for a six-month run-in

647
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,960
period for one-third of these kids so

648
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,120
that we have two different time points

649
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,799
before treatment. That helps us

650
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,480
understand a little bit better what they

651
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,159
looked like before treatment and then we

652
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,000
can see what they look like after

653
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,440
treatment and we can also still compare

654
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,600
them to those that go straight into

655
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
treatment. So, it just gives us even a

656
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,600
little bit more information. I

657
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,679
understand it's a bummer to be in a no

658
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,559
treatment control period for six months.

659
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,480
Um, but it really will help us answer

660
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,600
the question scientifically, I think, in

661
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,880
a more rigorous way. And as I mentioned,

662
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,480
everybody gets to roll into that

663
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,000
long-term extension study should they

664
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,080
choose to continue on the journey with

665
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,480
us. Um, so drug remains available to

666
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
patients um after their participation in

667
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,240
Aurora.

668
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,559
So, how can you get more information?

669
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,320
Um, we have a team out here, of course.

670
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,480
Um, and we also have a team that you can

671
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,320
email directly. um they're able to take

672
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,760
your information, help connect you to

673
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,080
clinical trial sites that are close to

674
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,440
you, help you answer some questions even

675
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,640
before you get to the site, help you

676
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,039
think through what questions might be

677
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,200
good to ask. But as Allison mentioned

678
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,279
earlier, please talk to your doctors,

679
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,720
talk to your families, talk to other

680
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,080
families and each other here to

681
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,919
understand what it's like to be in a

682
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,279
clinical trial and decide if these are

683
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,760
um the decisions you want to make for

684
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:12,559
you and your family. So um I will final

685
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,960
uh end here. Um, our phase one two trial

686
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,799
showed promising uh benefit risk

687
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,080
profile, meaning we get to continue to

688
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,840
study. Our global phase three Aspire

689
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,360
trial completed enrollment this summer

690
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,360
and we get to look at that data when

691
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,799
it's ready. Um, all of our participants

692
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,640
uh continue to receive drug through a

693
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,799
long-term extension study and we get to

694
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,760
understand those long-term impacts um

695
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,679
from safety and efficacy both.

696
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,360
And then Aurora has opened. We're super

697
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,720
excited. Um, and you can get more

698
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,559
information on that study at ct.gov.

699
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,320
And then finally, the MDRI we think is a

700
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,159
powerful tool. So, one last plug for it.

701
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,760
Uh, we think we can measure meaningful

702
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,360
improvement across multiple domains at

703
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,440
one time. And we think that's a really

704
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,760
nice way to look at efficacy data in a

705
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,640
complex disorder like Angelman syndrome.

706
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,640
So, thank you so much.

707
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:02,247
[snorts]

708
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,840
incredible and thank you for all of that

709
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,600
and you know that's a whirlwind of an

710
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
unbelievable amount of work over the

711
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,919
last five years and so it's amazing

712
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,600
where we are and how far we've come and

713
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,159
I just want to acknowledge to the

714
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,919
community that the day the press release

715
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,039
came out that the first patient was

716
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,679
dosed in Aurora I got an email from Amal

717
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,880
Khakis that said I told you we would

718
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,279
keep our promise and That's because we

719
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,159
made them promise, as we have to all

720
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:43,320
sponsors, that they would include all

721
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,320
ages and all genotypes. And they did.
