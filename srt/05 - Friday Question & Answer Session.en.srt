1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
I'm going to open the floor to questions

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,720
and and I'm going to take most of them

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,880
and I want you guys to really find the

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,559
speakers in the break and and throughout

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
the course of the next two days to ask

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,400
them your questions. Families in this

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
room should not be scared to approach

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
anybody else in this room. This is your

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,039
day. The next two days is yours. You

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,119
should go and talk to everybody. You

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,760
should engage and you should ask any

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,599
question you have. Um, but I am happy to

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,840
just take some questions that you might

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
be thinking about and try to address

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,399
them in a way that's pertinent to you

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
and your family. So, if we want to ask

17
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,200
any questions, otherwise we can go ahead

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,200
and and start the break.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,680
>> I can't There's a question over there. I

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
can't see anything up here. So, if there

21
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,480
are runners, it would be really great if

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,480
you guys can just go and find those

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
people.

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:10,479
Hello. Thank you. Um, I have a couple of

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:15,360
questions for uh the John Hopkins uh set

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:21,119
um who explain very well the functions

27
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:25,840
of UB3A protein sorry DAC.

28
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:30,960
Um so uh I have the first question is uh

29
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,439
if there's um any protein accumulation

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
um documented

31
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:42,720
uh wherever the UB3

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:48,240
UB3A is lacking or um uh mutated

33
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:54,520
and also um why they do explain the

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,520
imprinting of UB3. 3A in the brain.

35
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,079
>> If I think I understood your question

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,360
and I apologize there's an echo. Um so

37
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,719
it was a little bit hard for me to

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,479
understand what you were saying but I

39
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,439
think what you're asking for is is there

40
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,680
accumulation of UB3 protein

41
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:18,800
>> no of other protein since the

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:22,000
uh UB3 is not binding its target. Um um

43
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,480
is there any protein accumulation

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,680
documented in the brain whenever uh the

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,879
UB3A is non functioning

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,000
other protein?

47
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,840
>> Right. Yes. Yes. So so because U3

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,920
targets thousands of other proteins

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,400
and if it's not targeting and and

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,640
tagging it to be degraded and in some

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,400
instances upregulated to not be

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,920
degraded. So there's a balance of

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,840
homeostasis.

54
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,080
So there's a balance where there's

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,480
targeting of a protein to say you should

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
be trash and there's targeting of

57
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
protein that says you should stick

58
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,480
around for a longer period of time. And

59
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,239
when you don't have that targeting

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,280
meaning the tag keep and throw, it's

61
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,640
completely unbalanced. So there are many

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,239
proteins that there are too many of them

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,280
and there are many proteins where there

64
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,760
are not enough of them. So replacing

65
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,599
certain proteins could be helpful or

66
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,000
targeting the breakdown of certain

67
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,599
proteins can be helpful. And that's why

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,080
when you think about all of the

69
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,840
downstream effects of the function of

70
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
UV3A,

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
there's hundreds if not thousands of

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,120
them

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,959
>> in the neurons specifically, but

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
probably in other cells of the body as

75
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,080
well. But we know in other cells of the

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,560
body, we have the paternal copy that's

77
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,920
being read because it's only silenced in

78
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,560
neurons. Yeah.

79
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,799
>> So it's mostly a neuronal disorder. And

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,319
when you look at the brains of animals

81
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,720
and humans actually for deceased brains,

82
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,640
when you look at the brains after and

83
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,560
before therapy and you can look at what

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,200
we call proteomics,

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,239
which is what is the downstream effect

86
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,400
and that signature, that signature is

87
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,879
very different in Angelmen syndrome

88
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,360
compared to neurotypical

89
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:14,319
and it's thousands of proteins that are

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,000
either upregulated or inappropriately

91
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,720
downregulated. So um can we say that

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
maybe that's why we don't see a

93
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,880
neurodeeneration

94
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,400
in a angelman syndrome patient?

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,199
>> Probably the reason we don't see

96
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,400
neurodeeneration is because the

97
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,960
imbalance of proteins that's there are

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,000
not degenerative proteins. So when you

99
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,639
think about something like ALS right the

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,479
proteins that are you know accumulating

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,560
are ultimately killing neurons

102
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
when you look at Alzheimer's disease the

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,320
plaques that are being deposited are

104
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:58,639
killing neurons alysisal storage disease

105
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,720
that it's resulting in not degrading

106
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
certain types of fats that are

107
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,919
accumulating in cells that cause cell

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
death. There are no proteins that we

109
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,639
know of in Angelmen syndrome that cause

110
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,080
cell death when they're upregulated or

111
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,639
downregulated. Which is why

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,800
anatomically, if you look at the MRI of

113
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,199
an adult with Angelmen syndrome, it

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,240
looks relatively normal. There may be

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,720
some delay in myelin depositing, but the

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
neurons themselves look anatomically

117
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600
normal. And when you see a report on an

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,720
MRI, it's generally normal compared to

119
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
what you might see with MPS Sanfalippo

120
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,880
that was just shown or what you would

121
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,720
see potentially with Alzheimer's or ALS

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,520
or something like that.

123
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,560
>> Thank you.

124
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,560
>> Sure. Next question.

125
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,840
>> Okay.

126
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,080
Yeah, just a clarifying question. Oh,

127
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,280
the echo is bad.

128
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,479
>> It's worse for me.

129
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,080
>> Okay. Um, regarding Dr. James

130
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:17,919
presentation, um, there was a comment

131
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:21,280
that AAV can't be used with UB3A

132
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,560
because of its size. And so just just

133
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,280
wondering what vectors could be used in

134
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
current or future trials.

135
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,759
>> That's a great that's a great question.

136
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,240
So most proteins or many proteins are

137
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,319
very large and there's a or genes are

138
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,199
very large and there's a capacity to a

139
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,680
vector like a generally it can hold only

140
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,800
a certain amount of genetic material.

141
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,759
For Angelmen, the gene can actually fit

142
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,800
in the vector, but the gene itself has

143
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,759
multiple isoforms, meaning that there's

144
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,000
a when you make UV3, it's enormous, but

145
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,120
there's certain pieces of it that are

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,120
this big or this big or this big. And

147
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,120
the function of those have been tested

148
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,160
in these models to show that one isoform

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,039
called isoform one for the human UB3A

150
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,840
construct is actually the smaller one.

151
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,639
and it has most of the function. So when

152
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,800
we give back isoform one, we see full

153
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,520
rescue of phenotype in the animal model.

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,440
When we give back isoform 2, we don't

155
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,199
see great rescue of the phenotype and

156
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,000
actually with too much of it, you can

157
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,400
see toxicity. So you don't want to give

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
back too much isoform 2 and isopform 3

159
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,280
practically doesn't exist. So basically

160
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
what we have shown is that with just

161
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
isoform one, you can correct the

162
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,680
symptoms of Angelmen syndrome. So there

163
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
are multiple programs using AEV for

164
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,960
Angelmen syndrome with gene delivery and

165
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,120
they're using isoform one because it

166
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,639
does fit and some people are actually

167
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,520
mixing isoform one and two in a um a

168
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,800
shorter form where it together does fit.

169
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
Um so that's something that's in

170
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,479
discovery at the University of North

171
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,479
Carolina.

172
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,080
Any other questions?

173
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,759
>> Is there another question?

174
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,440
>> Okay, why don't we go for a break?

175
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
Everyone chitchat. Go have some coffee

176
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,560
and we'll be back here at
