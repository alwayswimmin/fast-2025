1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,120
Hopefully she didn't go too far. She's

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,439
coming back up and she's going to talk

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,439
to you about biomarkers.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,160
>> Thanks.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,639
All right. I know I'm between you and

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,880
lunch so I will be fast.

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,520
Um these are my disclosures. All right.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,520
So biomarkers uh biomarkers are

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,080
characteristics that you can measure in

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,880
the body. And so it's not an outcome

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,679
like um I don't have any verbal

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,160
communication skills or I have limited

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,719
mobility. Biomarkers are objective

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,399
measures that we can measure. And in

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,600
Angelman syndrome, we look at CSF, EEG,

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
and MRI. These are some of the

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
biomarkers that we're interested in

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,399
because they're relevant to individuals

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,680
with Angelman syndrome. Um on the right

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,320
here, what you'll see is essentially um

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,480
FDA's road map of what biomarkers can

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,280
do. Um they can be diagnostic. So it

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,680
could be a gene test for diagnosis of a

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,640
disease. Um they could be for safety

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,799
reasons. So maybe you have an antibbody

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
at baseline and if you were going to get

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
a specific treatment, maybe that's not

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,159
safe for you. But what ABOM is really

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,200
focused on are biomarkers that predict

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,600
response or or indicate a response to a

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,200
treatment which are efficacy biomarkers

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,439
or sometimes you might hear them

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,200
referred to as surrogate endpoints. So

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,400
this is kind of what we we've been

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,560
looking at as the Abomb. So first you

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,320
have to understand what is an endpoint.

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
So an endpoint is something that you

38
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
measure in a clinical trial. a targeted

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,439
outcome in a clinical trial that you

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,159
analyze statistically to determine if a

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,840
drug is safe and effective. And the way

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,640
that we do that is we include outcomes

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
that are relevant to the disorder. So in

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
Angelman syndrome, it could be

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,240
communication, sleep, activities of

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,399
daily living and and whatnot. These are

47
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,920
outcomes. And then you pick an outcome

48
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,680
and say, "I'm going to look at the

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
change in this outcome from

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,360
pre-treatment to after treatment to

51
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,799
determine if there was a response."

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,840
Um, usually an outcome measure focuses

53
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,319
on a way a patient feels or functions.

54
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
So when I mentioned communication, that

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,879
would be sort of how a patient is

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,520
functioning or an individual with

57
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,599
Angelin syndrome that has limited uh

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
speech capabilities or communication

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,040
capabilities, we might look at that as

60
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,560
an outcome in terms of how they are

61
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,720
functioning. Um and importantly, outcome

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,800
measures should be relevant to the

63
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,360
disorder. It seems obvious, but they

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
really need to be relevant and ideally

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,319
capturing what matters to you, which I

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,720
just mentioned in the prior

67
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,280
presentation. On the bottom here, this

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,640
graph is the top 10 treatment priorities

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,720
as determined by the PFDD survey. It's

70
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,239
in the voice of the patient report. And

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,519
so what we're trying to do is make sure

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,920
we have outcomes that capture symptoms

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,760
that you rank as important. So, for

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,560
example, we wouldn't want to do a study

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,640
that's focused on pain if you say, "I

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,400
don't care about pain or how much pain

77
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,239
my child has. What I care about is do

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
they communicate more effectively? Do

79
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,599
they understand me better?

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,159
Biomarkers can sometimes also be

81
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,440
endpoints in clinical trials. And this

82
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,280
is what I mentioned before as a

83
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,640
surrogate endpoint. And that's a

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,879
biomarker like measuring blood or CSF

85
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,040
that's thought to predict clinical

86
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,120
benefit. and meaning that you're not

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,519
measuring how a patient feels or

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
functions through the biioarker, but you

89
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,280
think that there's a relationship

90
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,519
between that biomarker and an outcome

91
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
measure so that the biomarker will

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,120
predict a change in that outcome measure

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
later. Um, and oftentimes you use

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,920
biomarkers as surrogate endpoints in

95
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,879
disorders when it takes a really long

96
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,599
time to measure that outcome. And so an

97
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
example of this would be in a a study

98
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,760
maybe where you were looking at people

99
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,319
with cardiovascular diseases and you

100
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
were trying to see if a drug changes the

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,720
number of strokes that happen in a

102
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,080
population. And so if you enrolled a

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,920
group of individuals that had risk

104
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,599
factors for stroke, if you had to follow

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,120
them until they all had or didn't have a

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,200
stroke, you might be following them for

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,120
a very very long time. And so usually

108
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,280
what happens instead is they focus on

109
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,280
other measures or biomarkers like blood

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
pressure and say okay if I give this

111
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
patient a drug and do I make their blood

112
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,120
pressure go down and then you can get an

113
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,360
approval off of that biioarker instead

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,880
of waiting all the way to see the

115
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,280
outcome.

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,120
But to do this, you have to accumulate

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,560
extensive evidence. And I want to say

118
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,960
extensive evidence because from a

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
regulatory perspective, FDA and other

120
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,080
agencies will really want you to show

121
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
that you you really know how the

122
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,880
biomarker does relate to that outcome.

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
And usually you need clinical trials to

124
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,600
do that to really prove the relationship

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,919
between that biomarker or surrogate

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,160
endpoint and the clinical outcome that

127
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,479
you think will be changed.

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,960
So if we think now about Angelman

129
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,320
syndrome, some of the biomarkers that we

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,560
believe are important and have

131
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,360
investigated as the Abomb um are EEG,

132
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,960
MRI and CSF markers. So I'll start with

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,000
EEG. So here you may have heard um in

134
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:13,120
some forums um delta power is measured.

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,199
So it's a parameter on EEG that we see

136
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,960
is increased during sleep and wake

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,440
periods in individuals with Angelman

138
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,400
syndrome. And if you start on the left,

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
you will see um in that plot there's a

140
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
red line and a gray line. And the red is

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
Angelman syndrome and the gray is a

142
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,960
neurotypical or a group of neurotypical

143
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,919
individuals. And you can see that this

144
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,720
delta band is increased clearly in

145
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,840
individuals with Angelmen syndrome. We

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,320
also know that this delta band or delta

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,320
power decreases over time with age just

148
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,080
naturally. But if you look at the middle

149
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,320
plot, you'll see the red is still higher

150
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,080
than the gray. So, it's still higher in

151
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
individuals with Angelman syndrome than

152
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,560
it is in neurotypical individuals. Um,

153
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
and this increased delta power is really

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,479
thought to be due to the lack of UB3A

155
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
that impacts synaptic functioning. And

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,680
you heard about both UB3A and some of

157
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,440
its effects this morning. If you look on

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
the all the way to the right, we see

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,520
that in individuals with deletion

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
mutations or non-deion mutations, it's a

161
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
little bit higher in individuals with

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,120
deletion, which might accord to the fact

163
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,800
that deletion is um usually the the most

164
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,400
severe presentation of Angelman

165
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
syndrome. And so it's very much

166
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,440
increased and there's a little bit of a

167
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,720
difference even between mutation types.

168
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
I'm not going to explain all of what's

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,000
in this plot, but essentially it's safe

170
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,240
to say that there's been some ABOM

171
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,319
groups or some ABOM members I should say

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
that have investigated how delta power

173
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
might relate to outcomes in Angelman

174
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
syndrome. And what they've seen through

175
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,560
data and analyses of the natural history

176
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,319
is that the higher your delta power is,

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
the lower your cognitive function would

178
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,479
be predicted to be. So they can see in

179
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,400
individuals with high delta power, their

180
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
cognitive abilities are lower. And so

181
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,039
that's how that relationship might

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,599
unfold. That if we bring delta power

183
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,599
down, maybe some abilities would would

184
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,840
grow.

185
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,280
Importantly, we know that the mouse, the

186
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,280
angelman mouse that you heard about this

187
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,520
morning, also has this delta power

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,360
increase. And there have been studies by

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,479
some of the groups involved in Abomb

190
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,400
that have looked at using an olucleotide

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,199
in a mouse. And if you look at the blue

192
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,360
group here, they took uh mice and they

193
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
gave them an anti-sense aloneucleotide

194
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
that targeted that paternal gene

195
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
anti-sense transcript to try to

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,240
unsilence the paternal uh gene and allow

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,560
UB3 expression. And so they treated

198
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,720
these mice, the blue group, and they

199
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,880
compared them to mice treated with a

200
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,160
control oligonucleotide. So either

201
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,199
angelin mice um on the left or in green

202
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,280
wild type or or or typical mice. They

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
saw that they were able to bring the

204
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,080
delta power down in the mice that were

205
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
treated with the incense oligoucleotide

206
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,840
that was specific for Angelman syndrome.

207
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
Whereas the mice that got the control

208
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,919
ASO that had Angelmen syndrome didn't

209
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
change at all. So we they saw with

210
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,960
treatment they could bring down this

211
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,879
delta power. Most importantly is now

212
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,360
through clinical trials evidence is

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,440
emerging that you can do the same in in

214
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,840
humans. And what they've seen in the red

215
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,319
here versus the blue, the red is the

216
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
natural history data predictions. So

217
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,080
again, the power of natural history data

218
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,800
because we can compare delta power in

219
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,639
untreated individuals versus treated. So

220
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,639
red is the natural history prediction

221
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,960
and blue is the treated group on an

222
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,360
olonucleotide. And you can see that

223
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,279
their delta power is coming down. And

224
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
importantly on the right, you could see

225
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,360
this group also had an increase in their

226
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,519
cognition abilities based on an

227
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,919
assessment by the Bailey scale. And so

228
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,920
it sort of is following that predicted

229
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,440
trend that if you improve their delta

230
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,800
power, you bring it down with treatment,

231
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,040
you might see a change in outcomes.

232
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,360
We're also looking at MRI as a potential

233
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,600
biomarker. We know very little about

234
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
this. What we do know um as Allison

235
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,360
mentioned in her talk is that

236
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,920
individuals with Angelman syndrome have

237
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,839
um delayed mileelination. And so what

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,560
you're looking at here is a plot of

239
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,399
individuals males and females with as in

240
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
the circles those sort of blue and

241
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,480
pinkish circles as compared to the

242
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,480
triangles which are neurotypical

243
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,560
population. And you can kind of see that

244
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,640
on average the brain size is a little

245
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
bit less in those younger individuals

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,800
with Angelin syndrome. If we could use

247
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
MRI that might be a nice way to see if

248
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,279
that changes with treatment and if that

249
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
if they catch up in that myelination and

250
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,240
then that brain volume. So that's

251
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,000
something that we're going to follow

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,680
further to explore and and look at.

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,839
And then we look at fluids. You heard

254
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,360
that um in Allison's talk. And this is

255
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,839
something we saw yesterday. We had some

256
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
really interesting talks at the Ebomb on

257
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,279
biomarkers yesterday. And one of them um

258
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,720
was about a a test that's run by a

259
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,240
company called Saskappa. And you're

260
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
going to hear Morty talk later today

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
about this in more detail. But what

262
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,959
they've done is take cerebrros spinal

263
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,440
fluid or CSF from individuals with

264
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,000
Angelman syndrome and also neurotypicals

265
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,959
to see if you if there is a difference

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
in their UB3A expression. So can you see

267
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,000
if there's protein that UB3A protein in

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,399
neurotypical individuals and then it's

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,519
missing in individuals with Angelman

270
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,760
syndrome? And that's in fact what

271
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
they've started to see on this test. And

272
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
I'll let uh Morty talk about that more

273
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,680
in his talk. But this is very important

274
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,480
from a regulatory perspective because if

275
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,480
we could measure UB3A, so if there was

276
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,959
none before treatment and then you see

277
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,040
it go up after treatment, that would be

278
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,440
an indicator of response to a therapy

279
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,279
that we could see earlier

280
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,120
maybe than some of the outcomes on the

281
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,360
clinical measures like the Bailey or the

282
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,200
Orca or the Vineland, right? It would

283
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,279
give us really early evidence and

284
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,440
powerful evidence of a change because

285
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,880
you wouldn't expect it to be there.

286
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
That's the lefth hand side. On the right

287
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
hand side, we also have a company called

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,240
Somalogic that's doing some um

289
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,760
exploration into proteins in the CSF.

290
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,760
And this is a busy plot, but if you

291
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
basically look at that bottom box in in

292
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,279
red where you see some pink and reds,

293
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,279
what we've started to see is there's

294
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,560
some protein signatures that's a little

295
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,200
bit different in individuals with

296
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,360
Angelman syndrome than neurotypicals.

297
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,480
And so we're we need to further explore

298
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,240
what those what those signatures mean.

299
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,880
Um and do they correlate to outcomes

300
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,000
that we don't know yet.

301
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,680
So based on what we know about EEG and

302
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,160
CSF and MRI, the question is are these

303
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,720
biomarkers uh surrogate endpoints yet?

304
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,279
Can we use these in trials and make that

305
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,160
sort of the primary focus and and look

306
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,040
at the outcomes later to maybe speed up

307
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,800
um our clinical trials and readouts?

308
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,240
Unfortunately, no. We're not there yet.

309
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,399
We just we're just not there yet. We

310
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,000
need to know more and your that your

311
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
data contributions and the samples that

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
you've provided help us explore this

313
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,519
further and it's not something we're

314
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
going to give up on but we're just not

315
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,720
there yet. We need to build more

316
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,480
evidence to to do this. And what I'm

317
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,399
showing here are the two phase three

318
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,240
trials that are ongoing now uh with

319
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,240
Ultragenics and Ionis. And you can see

320
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,240
their primary outcome measures are on

321
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,519
the Bailey scale some aspect of the

322
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,519
Bailey scale. And that's because we're

323
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,519
not there yet with those um other

324
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
measures including delta power to

325
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,480
utilize that as the primary focus of the

326
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
trial.

327
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,160
This is a busy slide, but what I want to

328
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,320
show you here is that biomarkers are

329
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,880
powerful even if they're not ready to be

330
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,519
a surrogate endpoint. And that's because

331
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,000
they provide really good objective

332
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
evidence that that rounds out your whole

333
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,079
data set and they can support outcome

334
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
measures. And I like to think of it as a

335
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,279
belt and suspenders in your clinical

336
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,079
trial. Um, Topherin is a drug that was

337
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,639
approved a few years ago for ALS. And in

338
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
the top two boxes here, I think I have a

339
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,600
build. Um, what I wanted to show you is

340
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
that they did a pivotal trial, so a

341
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,839
phase three trial in individuals with

342
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,560
ALS, and they used a rating scale that's

343
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,240
assessed by a doctor to look at whether

344
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,079
or not their symptoms of ALS are

345
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,320
improving. So sometimes when you have

346
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
these scales, you can have variability

347
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
from doctor to doctor and how they

348
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,480
assess it. Even if you really try to

349
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
train them up and make sure there's

350
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
consistency, there's a little bit of

351
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,839
variability. And so sometimes that

352
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,839
impacts the analysis. And what happened

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,760
in this study was that they failed. They

354
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,920
they did not hit that primary endpoint.

355
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,320
It was not um successful. But they had

356
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,560
studied a biomarker called NFL or

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,079
neuropilament light chain. And there had

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,519
been a lot of work to understand what

359
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,600
does this mean in ALS? and it's

360
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,839
basically a marker of neurons

361
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,160
degenerating and they understood that it

362
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,160
related to the progression of ALS and

363
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,160
this was part of the trial and so even

364
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,839
though they failed the primary outcome

365
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,920
the FDA said well you know we've learned

366
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
a lot about NFL and what we see in your

367
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
data set what you're showing us is that

368
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,800
in patients that have a reduction in NFL

369
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,680
they also have like the best reduction

370
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,360
in their ALS rating score so there's

371
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,959
some sort of relationship there with

372
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,639
bringing down this biioarker and

373
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,440
improvement even if you failed the

374
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,880
primary end point. And so even though

375
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,040
you didn't hit what you were supposed to

376
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,040
hit, when we look at the total package

377
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,320
of evidence, we think that there's

378
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,440
something there and we're going to

379
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,959
approve this basically um on this

380
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,560
surrogate endpoint, even though that's

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,760
not where you started, that's where

382
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
you're going to end up because this

383
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,480
evidence was persuasive and we feel like

384
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,639
biologically something's going on. And

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,720
that's what good biomarkers can do. they

386
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,320
sort of build up and provide evidence

387
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
that something is happening at a

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,399
biological level even if some of the

389
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,320
outcome measures um don't really show

390
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,199
that yet.

391
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,519
The other thing that biomarkers do are

392
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,440
they can revol revolutionize the

393
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,639
landscape of development and this is

394
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,040
because sometimes you can read out these

395
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,800
biomarkers very early and I'm showing

396
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,760
you here a paper about multiple

397
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,240
sclerosis and they had a real explosion

398
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,639
in that area because they had

399
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,399
advancements in MRI technologies and

400
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,880
they started to have better confidence

401
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,920
that they could measure the lesions on

402
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,519
the brain that are involved in MS and

403
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,600
predict how that would relate to how the

404
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,079
patient felt and functioned in terms of

405
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,680
like their relapse relapse activity. And

406
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,079
so what they did was they built this

407
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,360
data set of correlating number of

408
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,440
lesions to activity in patients. And

409
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,360
they could basically start to see that

410
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,079
if we treat patients with the drug and

411
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,399
we see these lesions go away, then we

412
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,880
have good confidence and good evidence

413
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,279
here that shows that they won't have as

414
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,440
much activity. they won't relapse as

415
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,480
much and have as much loss of function

416
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,120
and feel bad. And what this did was

417
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,120
absolutely explode that area because

418
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,279
companies could come in and say, "I'm

419
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,440
going to do a short study and I'm going

420
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,120
to look at MRI over three months and I'm

421
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
going to know whether this drug works or

422
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,639
doesn't. And if it works, I'm going to

423
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
put money into developing it and if it

424
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,160
doesn't, we're going to move on to

425
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,160
something else." And this area has, I

426
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,360
think, over 20 approved therapies. I I

427
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,279
can't even count how many therapies

428
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,199
there are approved for MS. But that

429
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,440
biioarker absolutely moved that

430
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
landscape and that's basically what we

431
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,199
want to do here. Even if these

432
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,199
biomarkers aren't providing us what we

433
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,800
want for today, we want to invest in

434
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,600
them for tomorrow because we may get to

435
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,560
a point where we can screen candidates

436
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,560
earlier and quickly make those good ones

437
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,720
advance and move away from things that

438
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,800
don't. And I just want to end by

439
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,240
thanking you for your contributions,

440
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,480
especially with bioarkers because

441
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
they're not easy to get. Um, thank you

442
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,759
so much because you are absolutely

443
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,406
enriching and informing the development

444
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,426
landscape. Thanks.

445
00:16:28,406 --> 00:16:30,426
[applause]

446
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,839
Thanks.

447
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,920
>> Okay. I'm the only thing standing

448
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,360
between you and lunch. I understand

449
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,720
that. Um, so we're going to get you

450
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,480
there. One thing I want to just announce

451

knows we have here some unbelievable and

460
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:11,600
highly experienced specialists in PT,

461
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:14,720
OT, speech therapy, ABA therapy, vision

462
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,679
therapy, neuro feedback, and feeding and

463
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,360
swallowing therapy. and you for free

464
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,439
families can sign up and have a

465
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,199
consultation with them. There's the meet

466
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,520
the specialist sign up if you walk out

have worked deeply with children with

473
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,640
Angelmen syndrome and adults and have

474
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,400
been incredibly supportive of helping

475
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,440
families get through whatever challenges

476
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
they're having and give them some

477
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,320
advice. So, please go out there and sign

478
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,720
up. If everyone wants to um break for

479
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,360
lunch, we're going to meet back in here

480
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,559
with your food um for a lunch and learn.

481
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
So, Ryan's going to talk to us about

482
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,640
advocacy, but you're welcome to bring

483
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,000
your food back in and um eat and listen

484
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,840
at 120. So, go out, have yourself some

485
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,520
food, bring it back in here. Everyone,

486
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,360
eat in here so Ryan can get started

487
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,760
while you're eating at 1:20. We'll see

488
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
you soon.
