1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,640
So, our next speaker is Dr. Raph Benjam

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,200
um coming to us from Arbor

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,800
Biotechnologies. I'm so happy that you

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,200
guys are here presenting today on this

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,759
stage. Just for the record, I've been

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,280
talking to Arbor for a long time. Um but

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,680
I have never been able to disclose that

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,359
I'm talking to Arbor for a long time.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,279
And the fact that they agreed to speak

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,119
to our families about their Angelman

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
program to disclose out of stealth that

12
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,279
they're working on Angelmen syndrome is

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,039
really exciting. And it's early days,

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,560
but we're super thrilled and we're so

15
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,560
great grateful to be able to support

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,560
you.

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,360
>> Good morning. Thank you Allison for the

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,719
introduction and uh it is truly an honor

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,320
to be standing in front of you today. My

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,680
name is Rafael Benjam. I'm here on

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,160
behalf of Arbor Bio and I'm going to be

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
talking to you today about uh novel gene

23
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,840
editing approaches for the potential

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
treatment of Angelman syndrome. Let me

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,680
see if this works. These are my

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,600
disclosures.

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,360
So I'll take a few seconds to briefly

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
tell you about Arbor Bio. Arbor is a

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,240
clinical stage company whose therapies

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,960
um leverage the potential of crisper

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,640
gene editing. Um, Arbor has several

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
pipelines in progress, including one

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,880
liver indication for PH1, currently in

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
phase one clinical trials, as well as

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,439
several CNS pipelines at different

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,840
stages of pre-clinical development. And

37
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,840
more recently, as Allison mentioned, um,

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,479
Arbor's gene editing technology combined

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,880
with our expertise in AEV delivery for

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,960
CNS disorders is now being applied to

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,040
the potential treatment of Angelmen

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,400
syndrome.

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,520
So, Arbor employs um about a little more

44
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,439
than 10 unique gene editors including uh

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,799
type five nucleaces and I'll tell you a

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
little bit about that in a second. But

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
before I do, I wanted to take a second

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,240
to briefly refresh your memory on the

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880
component of crisper and you've heard

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,640
about crisper many points uh during the

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,439
past three days. And I'll just be quick

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,439
and tell you that um crisper gene

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,240
editing allows for the precise

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,079
modification or disruption of a

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,720
particular gene of interest. And it does

56
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,120
so by using two main components. The

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
first is the cast protein which is this

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,720
red kidney bean shape here on the

59
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,280
diagram. And the cast protein serves as

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,440
a molecular scissor to disrupt the the

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,800
gene of interest. And it does so thanks

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,440
to the guide um by by the gRNA or guide

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,440
RNA which will bring the CAS protein to

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,120
to the gene of interest. And you should

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,760
also know that there are at least six

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,959
major types of crisper gene editors. And

67
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,640
I'll talk about two specifically today.

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,519
Type two nucleases are the most

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,360
well-known and cast 9 and is an example

70
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,840
of type two nucleases. You've heard

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,480
about cast 9 many times during the past

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,120
three days. Cast 9 is widely used in

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,480
clinical trials and is even FDA approved

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,760
for the treatment of cickle cell

75
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,599
disease. In uh contrast, type five

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,480
nucleases

77
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,560
um are less wellknown but are

78
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,400
particularly well suited for use in

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,440
therapeutics for the following two

80
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,959
reasons. The first is that on average

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,680
there are smaller than type two

82
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,280
nucleases and their guide RNAs are

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:19,280
smaller as well which makes packaging

84
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,959
type five nucleuses into AVs easier. And

85
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
the second reason is they have a

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
different type of cut compared to type

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,200
two nucleases. Um, type five nucleaces

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,959
will perform a staggered cut shown here

89
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,720
which will typically lead toward larger

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,519
deletion which is particularly

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,440
advantageous when disrupting the UB3A

92
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,799
ATS.

93
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,760
And so it is no surprise to hear that

94
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:49,680
Arbor's AS pipeline will um target the

95
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,319
will aim to disrupt the UB3A ATS um in

96
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,640
an attempt to unsilent dad's gene or as

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
is commonly known as fast circles as

98
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,360
pillar 2.

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,760
And to delve into um our therapeutic

100
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,760
approach a little deeper, Arbur's gene

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
editor is intended to be packaged into

102
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,720
an AEV and intended for a one-time

103
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,120
administration and the potential there

104
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,640
is for durable unsilencing of paternal

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,720
UB3A.

106
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,720
The clinical benefits of this approach

107
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
have been demonstrated by ASOS currently

108
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,959
in clinical trials and you'll hear about

109
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,680
those updates um later today. And

110
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,680
finally, arbor's small nucleus leaves

111
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
room for incorporation of different

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
safety features, potential safety

113
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,440
features to prevent sustained nucleus

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
expression.

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,840
And so I'll now walk you through the

116
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,000
different stages of our preclinical in

117
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,919
vitro developments starting with our

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
high throughput screening. Now a

119
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,720
targeted region within the UB3A ATS

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,560
locus spans around 50,000 bases which is

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,440
quite large and we therefore had to

122
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,520
screen many guides around 300 first in

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,040
an immortalized cell line to first

124
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,720
filter out guides with poor activity.

125
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,479
The guides that made it through were

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,120
validated in IPS derived human cortical

127
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,960
neurons derived from Angelmen patient

128
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,800
and with those we were able to rank the

129
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,479
guides based on their ability to um

130
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,039
recover UB3A protein expression.

131
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
The top candidates were then optimized

132
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,320
and we were able to improve their

133
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,080
potency by up to 14 folds. And we were

134
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,400
able to demonstrate that our top

135
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,000
candidates can recover an invitro

136
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,720
phenotype

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,600
um and reverse hyperexitability

138
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,919
um in Angelmen neurons in vitro. And

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,479
I'll now uh briefly highlight some key

140
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
data sets to uh show you the the

141
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,360
progress that we've made since the

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,759
assumption of this project. So what

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,400
you're seeing here is a graph that

144
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
illustrates the UB3A protein expression

145
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,080
recovery of an Angelman neuron following

146
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,720
the treatment with our top um nucleus

147
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,280
and guide combinations. The bar in red

148
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
is showing UB3A expression of a

149
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,000
neurotypical control and the average of

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
that expression is shown by the top

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,039
dotted line.

152
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,120
The expression of UB3A in an angelman

153
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,360
neuron untreated Angelman neuron is

154
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,280
shown in gray and the average of that

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,120
expression is shown by the bottom dotted

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,639
line.

157
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,240
In green are 14 candidates uh 14

158
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,919
candidates spanning two different

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,560
nucleases and several guides and they

160
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,680
show different varying levels of UB3

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,840
protein recovery. In orange are two

162
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
guides that are able to reach levels

163
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,319
similar to those of neurotypical

164
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,400
control. In blue are seven more guides

165
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,720
that are close to reaching neurotypical

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,720
control, but more importantly that are

167
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,000
able to reach levels similar to a

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,600
researchgrade ASO uh designed and

169
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,199
published by the Dindo lab that we have

170
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,120
been using as a benchmark in these

171
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,039
assays.

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,520
And now that we were able to show

173
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,520
robustly that we can recover UB through

174
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
protein expression angelman neurons, our

175
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
next question was do those top

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,360
candidates are they able to reverse an

177
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,599
invitro phenotype? And in the literature

178
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,880
there are reports that Angeloman neurons

179
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,039
exhibit elevated excitability

180
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,520
and this has been shown in both IPS

181
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,720
derived neurons in vitro as well as the

182
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,599
Angelmen neuron models in vivo.

183
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,160
And so we chose to use a machine called

184
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,440
the MEA or multi-elerode array. And this

185
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,520
machine allows us to quantify a neuron's

186
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,919
electrical activity in the dish. And

187
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,400
more specifically, it allows us to

188
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,800
compare the excitability of an Angelman

189
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,080
neuron compared to a neurot neurotypical

190
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,360
neuron and ultimately allows us to

191
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,599
prioritize guides based on their ability

192
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,440
to reduce hyperexitability in vitro.

193
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,000
So I'll walk you through the data. The

194
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,800
graph on the left here shows a measure

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,440
of synchrony. Um the higher the number,

196
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,840
the higher the synchrony. And you should

197
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,240
know that a hypoexitable neuron, one of

198
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,800
the hallmarks is an elevated synchrony.

199
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,879
And we see that data reflected here. An

200
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,280
angelman neuron in red is showing

201
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,639
elevated synchrony compared to two

202
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,280
neurotypical lines in blue. And so after

203
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,000
treatment with our top candidates, we

204
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,120
are able to reduce the synchrony of the

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,280
angel minuron once again in red down to

206
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,280
neuro to neurotypical range. And you see

207
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,159
that with two guides in light and dark

208
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,640
green. And the quantification of that is

209
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,360
shown in the graph on the right um with

210
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,159
area under the curve acting as a proxy

211
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,000
for uh synchrony. The lower the number,

212
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,080
the lower the synchrony. And we see that

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
our guys are able to reduce that

214
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,080
synchrony of Angelmen neurons down to

215
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,920
neurotypical levels. And more

216
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,320
interestingly, we saw a high correlation

217
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,920
of the percentage of reduction of

218
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,399
hypersynchrony and the percentage of UBA

219
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,640
UB3A protein recovery with those same

220
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,640
guides.

221
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,360
So I'll quickly summarize what I've just

222
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,360
told you. Arbur's gene editor um is are

223
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,600
intended to be packaged in an AEV and

224
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
intended for one-time administration and

225
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,800
the potential there is for durable

226
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,360
unsilencing of paternal UB3A. Our top

227
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,160
gene editors and guide RNA candidates

228
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,720
are able to recover UB3A protein level

229
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,600
in Angelmen neurons to neurotypical

230
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,120
level. We've shown that we can develop a

231
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,720
novel in vitro um assay on the MEA and

232
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,120
replicate a previously reported

233
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
phenotype of hyperexitability

234
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,760
and our top candidates can reverse the

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,480
hyperexitability phenotype to

236
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,680
neurotypical range. And so I'll end my

237
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,000
talk by thanking you thinking fast the

238
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,880
organizers for the invitation to speak

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,399
today. Thank you to Allison for being um

240
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,920
a thought partner, as she said earlier

241
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,000
in the talk, a thought partner from the

242
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,760
beginning of this project. And of

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,560
course, thank you to the Angelment

244
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,000
community. Um this community is one of a

245
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,000
kind. I'm sure you know this. And your

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,560
um continued attendance at this meeting

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,560
and your continued advocacy and support

248
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,440
of drug development efforts for your

249
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,279
loved ones living with AS is inspiring.

250
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,600
So, thank you for your support and thank

251
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,600
you for your attention today.

252
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Awesome.

253
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,680
So for anybody who didn't understand

254
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,920
that because that was beautiful science.

255
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,839
Basically various different guides that

256
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,680
target different parts of the anticense

257
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,160
had different benefit showing that you

258
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,440
can knock down the antisense upreculate

259
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,920
the protein and rescue what is almost

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
like a seizure phenotype or the cells

261
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,120
that are that are excitable the neurons

262
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
that are excitable. You can actually

263
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,120
rescue that to bring it to more

264
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,120
neurotypical or or normal levels in

265
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,040
neurons. And so you can see that

266
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,120
sequence matters, location of where

267
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,600
you're targeting matters. And to be able

268
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,279
to find the best um the best solution

269
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,959
and the best candidate, you want to be

270
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,600
able to address that in the greatest way

271
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,560
with expressing the most amount of UB3A

272
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,800
and rescuing a behavior like seizure

273
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
activity in a neuron. So that's really

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,160
exciting work and I really look forward

275
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,160
to seeing that go forward in vivo.
