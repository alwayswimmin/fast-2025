1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,839
Our next speaker, um, I am so happy to

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,400
welcome you back, Brenda. Uh, Dr. Brenda

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,360
Vincenzi is coming to us from Oakill

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,840
Bio. If you all remember, she is the

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,800
woman with the greatest accent ever that

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,400
used to present on the Ro ASO clinical

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,279
program for Ruga Nursson in the phase

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,279
one two, but she is back and she is

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,320
going to be talking to us about the

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,920
phase three study, the Beacon study for

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,119
Ruga Nursen, lighting the way for

12
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,119
Angelmen Syndrome. Brenda

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,360
accent.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,520
>> I love your accent.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640
>> Hi everyone. I know that Alison miss my

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,960
Italian accent.

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,760
So yeah, my name is Brenda Vincenti. I'm

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,239
an MD and as Alison said, I used to be

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,320
the medical lead for the Rugo nursing

20
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,399
trial at Rush. H I recently joined. You

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,199
probably know that Okil Bio has acquired

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,320
Rug Nursen from ROS and I recently

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,400
joined the company along with other uh

24
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,600
three exos colleagues that were part of

25
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
the Rug Nursen team.

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
A brief disclosure. So Ruggon is an

27
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,479
investigational medicine that has not

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,720
been approved for the treatment of any

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,960
diseases by the FDA or any other

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
regulatory authorities.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,520
And here you see the agenda for today.

32
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,080
Um I'll give you a brief introduction to

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,759
the company to Oakill Bio and then we go

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,520
into the Angelman syndrome program

35
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
history and the mechanism of action of

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,759
Ruggon

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,920
the results of Tangelo our phase one uh

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,040
trial that was recently completed and

39
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,399
the results are published on in nature

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,040
medicine and our plans as Eliso

41
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,720
mentioned to uh for our phase three

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,600
study called the beacon

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,560
oak biosil bio and the mission of the

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,360
company is really to rescue and advance

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,719
promising they prioritize molecules

46
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,200
exactly like rugon if you work in you

47
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,840
know in in pharmaceutical companies you

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
you know that sometimes for internal

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,480
reasons nothing to do with the molecule

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,400
or the safety or the lack of efficacy

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,120
some molecules are somehow the

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,160
prioritized and Okil bio and did the

53
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,040
same with another molecule in neonatlogy

54
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,959
acquired uh rugon to continue his

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,480
clinical development and to really like

56
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,120
start the phase three.

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,239
Here is our uh team that we are all

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,879
present here at fast and we have a booth

59
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,360
outside just outside the the room. So if

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,720
you would like to stop by and to say hi

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,519
we would really like to meet you in

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,440
person and as you can see like four out

63
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,760
of five like we're actually exhaust

64
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,640
a part of the rugen team. So we are very

65
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,640
very happy to be back and thank you very

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,680
much to fast for inviting Okil Bio.

67
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,760
Our ways of working. So we are uh

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
committed to transparent communication

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,319
to the Angelman syndrome community.

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
Whenever possible we aim to share

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,599
updates during the journey toward the

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,599
first patient enrolled into the BCON

73
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,599
trial

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,599
in German syndrome. the program history

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,680
and the mechanism of action of nursing.

76
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,920
Here you see so we've been working with

77
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
with the Angelman syndrome community for

78
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
a number of years now and we we

79
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,920
highlighted the most important uh um

80
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
elements that and and then publications

81
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,280
and studies that we have completed so

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,200
far. So back in 2015 we developed the

83
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
disease concept model in collaboration

84
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,840
with a bomb to really understand what's

85
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,319
important like for clinician clinicians

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,840
and caregivers when we develop a

87
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,799
molecule like to treat Angelerman

88
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,799
syndrome the observational study in

89
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,439
collaboration with biogenionis called

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,159
frias that was completed and then

91
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,319
tangelo our phase one uh trial with

92
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,720
rugon which I will describe later

93
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,120
especially the the results recently

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
published and then rush completed a PET

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,879
study to really understand the

96
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,720
biodistribution of rug nurse and when

97
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,880
administered uh through alumba puncture

98
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,600
and where we are today we are very close

99
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,520
to start the beon phase three trial

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,360
mechanism of action organis so I'm not

101
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,600
going to go of course into details of

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,120
the biology of that you know very well

103
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,240
but here's the mechanism of action so

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,199
organ is an anti-sensor lionucleotide

105
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,400
that really targets this long block this

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,720
long anticense which is responsible for

107
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,600
silencing the patternal alil in

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,120
individuals withman syndrome. So you see

109
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,759
the the arrow here uh rogon like targets

110
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,639
the antisense remove the block so that

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,600
the patternal alil is free to express

112
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
the ubit protein which is missing in the

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,199
brain of individuals with enjaman

114
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,199
syndrome.

115
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
Here's um an overview of the drug

116
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,280
development process. You also heard this

117
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,639
morning like it takes a long time like

118
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,120
for drugs to reach the market and um

119
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,120
unfortunately sometimes many of these

120
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,720
molecules they die through throughout

121
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
the process of of development. So the

122
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,120
first step is discovery. So the first

123
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,080
things that we need to do is really to

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,000
identify like our target and uh at that

125
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,520
point the rogon was one of more than

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,800
2,000 anti-sense oligonucleotide that

127
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,039
were investigated at rush and that was

128
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,199
brought ahead into what we call the

129
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,440
preclinical phase of development meaning

130
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,120
that we um we test rugersonen in uh

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
animals in different species we have

132
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,039
toxicology studies so a number of

133
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,680
studies and When everything is ready,

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
all the dosier is is submitted to the

135
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,039
health authorities. In this case in the

136
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,280
US, the FDA the FDA gave us like their

137
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,199
green light to start what we call the

138
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,160
clinical development. Meaning that we

139
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
were ready to start to test Rugon in uh

140
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,840
in the clinic in individuals with

141
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:15,199
Angelman syndrome. And so we started

142
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,759
Tangelo Tangela our phase one study. And

143
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,919
in rare diseases sometimes we go a bit

144
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,160
faster like we saw from a phase one or

145
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,080
phase one two. uh we go directly into

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,240
phase phase three and that's exactly

147
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,360
where we are today uh almost ready to

148
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,360
start our phase three beacon

149
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,680
um the reason why we believe in rugon so

150
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,080
first of all and I'm always very excited

151
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,080
like to show that graph that that you

152
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,199
see on the left side the preclinical we

153
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,240
have preclinical evidence like that rug

154
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,400
nursing when administered in animals in

155
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
this case in monkeys does exactly what

156
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
it's supposed to be doing meaning that

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,639
what We want to see when is a minister

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,479
intratically in in this case in a monkey

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,160
we want to see that that block that I

160
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,560
mentioned before the anti-sense goes

161
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,680
down and is kept down and that's the is

162
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,840
the um orange line that you see on the

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
graph but that's not sufficient what we

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
want to see is that the mRNA so that

165
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
contains all the informations to make

166
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,960
the protein is going up and that's uh

167
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
you see like on on the the yellow line

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,039
on the graph but the most important

169
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
thing that we want to see is the protein

170
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,560
the U3 protein that is reexpressed and

171
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,039
is going up and maintain up to 85 days

172
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,440
at least that that's where we uh stopped

173
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,360
the measuring

174
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,599
now and we presented that the

175
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,280
preclinical evidence like many times but

176
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,160
now we are in a different position we

177
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,520
also have clinical data we have data

178
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,000
from 61 individuals age 1 to 12 that

179
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,520
were enrolled in the tangelo study that

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,080
shows that rug nursing treatment led to

181
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,400
reduction of abnormal brain activity ity

182
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,599
the EG the delta band that you heard

183
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,000
many times and also led to improvements

184
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,879
in cognition, expressive communication

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,879
and other uh domains and we at different

186
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,879
skills.

187
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,759
Um so the reason why we believe we look

188
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,360
uh into all of this so we have a

189
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,000
preclinical data that confirms the rugon

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,879
um is a potent drug that really

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,520
reexpressed the ubitrain in in animals

192
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:25,280
in monkeys. We have the pet study. This

193
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,400
uh uh the study that was run at rush uh

194
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,840
with micro doses of rugon that was were

195
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,120
administered intratically uh to um

196
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,519
healthy adults to really see where does

197
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,440
rug nursing go when once is administered

198
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,919
intratically. So we really know that

199
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,159
rugon gets to the brain and then we have

200
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,800
tangelo clinical data that shows that

201
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,080
rugon is safe and otherwhat tolerated in

202
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,560
the clinic and also shows um efficacy

203
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,800
respiratory efficacy at both the eg and

204
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,800
the scales.

205
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,080
So overall you see that we have a potent

206
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,560
drug like rugoner is is has a high

207
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,240
potency. We can go high with the dose

208
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,640
and overall the high potency uh sum up

209
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
with a high dose is giving us a high

210
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,600
potential of translating this into

211
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,040
clinical benefit for individuals with

212
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,839
engineerman syndrome.

213
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,080
Now Tangelo the phase one study so

214
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,120
tangelo started a few years ago was

215
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,519
recently completed by rash is an open

216
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,959
label study so everyone received rugon

217
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,839
and the active drug we enrolled 61

218
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,480
individuals age 1 to 12 with either a

219
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,240
deletion or mutation genotype. We

220
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,240
started with what we call the multiple

221
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
ascending dose part of the study when we

222
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,880
started with very low doses and with

223
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,040
older children 5 to 12 and then little

224
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,320
by little we do escalated every time

225
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,399
that we had a um we look at the data. We

226
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,160
had an external monitoring committee to

227
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,839
look at the safety data and they were

228
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,560
given the green light to continue to

229
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,480
those escalate. Once the MID part of the

230
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,200
study was completed, then we started the

231
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,839
long-term extension like to continuously

232
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,160
uh observe the uh the long-term

233
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,600
efficacy, respiratory efficacy and

234
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,680
safety and tolerability of rugon. The

235
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,800
main goals, the primary goals of the

236
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,800
study were safety and tolerability,

237
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,200
understand the drug behavior and that

238
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,120
what we call exploratory efficacy. So to

239
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,920
look at the EG and to look at the skills

240
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,920
and here you see exactly like what um

241
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,720
what I just described. So we start with

242
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,720
the Bailey in uh on the slide you see

243
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
the cognition and expressive

244
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
communication and the MID and the

245
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,680
long-term extension part of the study.

246
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,240
In red you see what we would expect from

247
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,279
from the natural history trajectory that

248
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,760
we know very well right from syndrome.

249
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,560
And then we see in blue the trajectory

250
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
of individual treated with rugon. And

251
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,800
you see that this is a positive outcome.

252
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,959
we see that rug nursing really improve

253
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,120
like the uh cognition and expressive

254
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,480
communication domains in individuals

255
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,680
with within. And then on the bottom um

256
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,480
graph you see the EG and um you see here

257
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,600
that the red line is the natural history

258
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,720
trajectory and the blue line is what we

259
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,200
see once individuals enrolled in Tajun

260
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,920
or received Rugon. So you see like the

261
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,040
acrylic this was a dose dependent effect

262
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,880
with decrease of the delta band uh once

263
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,440
uh individuals were treated with roners.

264
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,120
On the on the right side you see a QR

265
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,800
code. So um the these data are published

266
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,160
in nature medicine. You see the

267
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,120
screenshot of the actual publication is

268
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,000
a scientific of course paper but the QR

269
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,680
code if you scan you are redirected to

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,920
fast US and to the lay language summary

271
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,720
of the tangelo results.

272
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,200
So overall um this was the this is the

273
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,160
first publish antisensor lingonucleotide

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,959
trial in Angelman syndrome

275
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,600
is safe and adequately tolerated. It may

276
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,279
improve brain activity, the EG and

277
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
development in children with Angelman

278
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,399
syndrome uh which showed significant

279
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,959
improvements in several developmental

280
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,920
skills. And now we are ready to start

281
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:25,200
the phase three beacon trial. But before

282
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,959
we go to the to Beacon uh you know that

283
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,680
as I mentioned we had a number of

284
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,440
families enrolled in the in the study.

285
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,200
So what happens to the family especially

286
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,600
now that there is this transition from

287
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,240
Russia to Okil bio. So I'm really

288
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,560
actually happy to share that Oil Bio has

289
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,839
started what we call the expanded access

290
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,079
program. So from families that uh wish

291
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,320
to continue to receive Rogo Nursen and

292
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,959
they have signed informed consent for

293
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
the optional open label extension part

294
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,480
of the Tangelo trial. They can continue

295
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:59,519
to receive the drug both in the US and

296
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,320
in Europe. The early access uh program

297
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,560
already started first in Europe and now

298
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,560
in in the US as well. There is an email

299
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,639
address for people that are interested

300
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,240
to learn more about the early access

301
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,360
program.

302
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,320
And now we go to BCON, our phase three.

303
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,200
So BCON is a randomized multi-enter

304
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,480
double blind placebo control phase three

305
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,600
clinical study to evaluate efficacy,

306
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:28,160
safety, pharmacodnamics of intratically

307
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,320
administer rug nursing, impediatric and

308
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,560
adult participants with syndrome.

309
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
more in details. We plan to enroll

310
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:42,240
approximately 150 participants age 1 to

311
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,320
50 uh included both males and females

312
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,200
with either a deletion or mutation

313
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,920
genotype. This is a global study and we

314
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,880
are planning to start in the US in Q1

315
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,000
next year.

316
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,639
Study design uh very simple study

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,680
design. We start like any other clinical

318
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,639
trial with the screening uh window and

319
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,560
then patient are randomized one to one.

320
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,880
So there is a 50% chance uh to um to go

321
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,079
into the rugur and the active arm or the

322
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
placebo arm. The first part uh last

323
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,760
approximately 12 months. After this

324
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,639
first part all participant will join the

325
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,399
open label part of the study which will

326
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,600
last approximately two years. So

327
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,519
everyone will receive rug nuren the

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,639
assessment this is not a comprehensive

329
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,360
list but we are planning to include uh

330
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,639
the user case so the ba4 of course we

331
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,680
continue with the eg uh clinical case

332
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,720
the cgi um and other caregiver

333
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,720
questionnaires the violand the the ora

334
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,279
the orca and and other skills

335
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,000
we are planning to support families of

336
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,519
course in bo every site and Every

337
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,160
country have their own guidance

338
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,760
regulation. So we do invite families to

339
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,000
really reach out to their own site to

340
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,920
really understand what kind of support

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,240
they are they expect to receive from

342
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,639
their sites. But we are planning to

343
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,320
support with travel with meals, family

344
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,199
hotels, stairs nearby if whenever needed

345
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,240
and then the comfort items uh during the

346
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,480
study visits.

347
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,800
This is my last slide. These are what we

348
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,680
call the inclusion exclusion criteria.

349
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,680
This again is not a comprehensive list

350
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,399
but who can take part of the beacon

351
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:34,480
trial as said before males and females

352
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,360
to children uh teens adults age 1 to 50

353
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,320
included with both a clinical and

354
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,800
genetic diagnosis of injur syndrome on

355
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,680
stable med medical condition and stable

356
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,600
medication for at least four weeks prior

357
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,199
to prior to screening depending on the

358
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,480
medication body weight um minimum 7

359
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,399
kilograms

360
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,800
caregivers. So the caregivers play a

361
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,519
very important role like in the BCON

362
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,759
trial so they can they have to attend

363
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,279
the visit, share updates and complete

364
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,040
questionnaires.

365
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,440
And there is an important note that you

366
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,880
see on the on the yellow part. We are

367
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,600
asking caregivers to not uh post any

368
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,440
