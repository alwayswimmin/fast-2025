1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,440
So now we are going to move to Dr. Morty

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,000
Razavi who's going to be presenting on a

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,240
UB3A assay, a biioarker as we talked

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,240
about earlier, um a potential biomarker

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,519
that we're looking at to measure UB3A

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,519
levels in the CSF. Morty,

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,480
>> thank you. It's good to be here with you

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,320
guys today. Um over the past 20 years

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,360
I've worked on maybe two 300 protein

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,280
biomarkers and I've only made emotional

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,280
connection to a handful of them and

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,719
UB31A1

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
uh is one of them. Um this is such a

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,960
master protein when you think about it

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,280
uh in our neurons for the function of

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,120
the brain for proper function of the

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,440
cells and this is what you've been

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,520
hearing all day that people are focusing

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,079
on developing therapeutics that can

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,800
replenish uh the neurons in Angelman

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,960
syndrome uh with this one protein and

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,439
that's why it's so important to me and

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,799
and our team regardless of the approach

24
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,119
that you're going to take for the

25
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,920
therapeutic the fundamental question

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
remains are you actually introducing

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,360
UB3A

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,080
uh in the neurons and what are the

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,240
levels of this protein uh and are they

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,600
able to be sustained over a long period

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,600
of time. So some of the reasons why you

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,439
would want to measure this protein in

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,600
the context of the therapeutics first

34
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,680
and foremost are you delivering the

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,799
protein where it needs to be delivered

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,119
to the neurons. Secondly, how much of it

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,000
is there after you do your gene therapy

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,079
or other forms of therapy? uh that's

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,119
crucial information that you need to

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,040
properly dose uh the therapeutic so that

41
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,360
the protein is is getting expressed at

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,000
the levels that it needs to be. And the

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,320
third thing is once you do both of those

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,960
things is a protein actually going to

45
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,680
stay there for a long enough period of

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,280
time and so longitudinal measurement of

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,719
this protein uh to make sure that uh the

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,119
results are sustained is going to be

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,800
important to all the all the therapies

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,520
out there.

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,800
So if you look at different ways that

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,680
people measure UB3A in different sample

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,480
types u you are looking at three

54
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,239
different uh assays. The first one is a

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,400
protein assay. There are different ways

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,000
of doing this. Uh but they're all

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,160
looking at the protein which is the

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
functional end here. That is the right

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,720
thing to do. That is the correct type of

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
biomarker to be looking at. The problem

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,840
that exists with these assays is

62
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
twofold.

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,840
um there are such low levels of this

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,239
protein in the neurons in in in CSF uh

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,640
that sometimes you're making a mistake.

66
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,720
Am I really measuring the correct thing?

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,680
And so the sensitivity of these assays

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,800
is usually where the challenge is. Uh a

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,879
different type of assay looks at the the

70
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,519
uh products of the genome. So you

71
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,519
measure the RNA, but the challenge there

72
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,080
is that you can make good measurements

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,080
of of these RNAs, but that doesn't

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
guarantee that the protein is actually

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,319
there. And so you want to go the next

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,480
level up and look at the protein as a

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
biomarker. And there are assays out

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,000
there that look at the tissue. You can

79
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,000
actually visualize where the protein is.

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,319
uh those are powerful assays, but

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,720
tissue, brain tissue is not the kind of

82
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,120
sample that you want to be working with

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,360
if you're running clinical trials. You

84
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,959
ideally want to have an assay that works

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,760
in in a surrogate matrix like the CSF.

86
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,519
uh and that's why um thanks to your

87
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,920
donations and under leadership of

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,239
Allison and Jennifer uh we started

89
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
developing a gold standard assay that is

90
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,799
sensitive enough to be able to

91
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,040
quantitate CS uh UB3A in CSF of Angelman

92
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,400
syndrome patients especially in support

93
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,040
of all the ongoing clinical trials.

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,799
So that work started about 18 months ago

95
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
and we've successfully developed this

96
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,519
gold standard assay. You're seeing some

97
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,159
measurements that we've made in actual

98
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,080
Angelman syndrome CSF samples that we

99
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,159
have received and we've determined the

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,280
levels in these samples to be on the

101
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,599
level of phentogram grams per mill.

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,400
The way to translate that to a lay

103
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,959
audience is that that's reminiscent of

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,840
looking at a bee on a flower on a lily

105
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,320
pad in a pond all the way from the space

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,639
station and you're doing that with your

107
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,080
naked eyes. So that's the level of

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,400
sensitivity we've been able to

109
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,400
accomplish with this assay. The next

110
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,560
levels are now that this tool is

111
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
available to the community, we're going

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,199
to start answering some important

113
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,400
biological questions. For example, is

114
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,560
UB3A neuronal or not? So we're working

115
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,880
with the community to get proper sample

116
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,880
types including age match neurotypical

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
samples to answer these kinds of

118
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,360
biological questions. And the second

119
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
thing we're doing as a company, we're

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,120
making sure that this assay is

121
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
commercially available to anybody who's

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,040
developing therapeutics. Any researcher

123
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,600
out there who is developing uh

124
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,160
methodologies for curing this disease,

125
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,759
if they need to measure UB3A, this assay

126
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,120
is available to them. On that note, u

127
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,680
huge thanks to fast to Allison and

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,600
Jennifer for uh bringing this really

129
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,600
interesting project to us and thank you

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
all uh for your support.
