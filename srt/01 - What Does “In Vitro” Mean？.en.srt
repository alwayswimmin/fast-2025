1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,240
We will start with our first talk and we

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,360
really wanted to kick off the day with

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,840
everybody being grounded in knowledge.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,880
As you all know, I feel very strongly

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,119
that knowledge is our power. But if we

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,520
don't understand what the people on this

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,600
stage are telling you, one, we're

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,199
wasting your time. And you being here

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
away from your family and getting

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,880
caregivers support is honestly a

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,560
privilege for us. We do not want to

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,120
waste one minute of your time being

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,120
here. So, we need to ground you in

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,600
knowledge, which means that we're going

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,120
to talk about different things this

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,360
morning. What does in vitro mean? What

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,239
does that mean? And why is it important

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,800
to develop drugs for our children? We're

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,039
going to follow that by what does invivo

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,520
mean? So in vitro in a dish in vivo

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,640
inside a body and then we're going to

22
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,680
talk about the UB3 gene. What is the

23
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,760
function of UB3A?

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,760
I can tell you what it doesn't do. Meet

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,720
my daughter. But what we're going to

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,479
learn is what it is supposed to do. And

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,760
that's very important for us to

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,640
understand if we give it back,

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,280
what symptoms we can address potentially

30
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,080
with that. And then we're going to talk

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,720
about what is gene therapy. Gene therapy

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,960
is a word we use all the time, but I

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
guarantee you 90% of you don't actually

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,200
know what it is. So, we're going to talk

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,159
about what it is. Really get a good

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,400
understanding to make very important

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,000
decisions about your child in the

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,920
future. You need to understand what

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,320
we're talking about. So, with that,

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,560
let's kick off the morning with Dr.

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,759
Michael Boland. Dr. Dr. Michael Bolan

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,119
comes to us from the University of

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,520
Pennsylvania Pearland School of

44
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,079
Medicine. I'm going to let him introduce

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,600
his incredible academic accolades

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,920
because he's one of the smartest people

47
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,560
that I know. He's a neuroscientist who's

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,640
incredibly brilliant. But the most

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,560
important title is he's a dad. And I'm

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,560
going to let you him tell his story.

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Michael,

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
>> thank you.

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
Thank you, Allison. Uh, it's it's an

54
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,120
incredible honor to be here and I'd like

55
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,760
to thank the organizers and uh fast for

56
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,239
for putting this on and for everyone

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,239
showing up to listen to this. So,

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,840
get my slides up.

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,680
There we go. So Allison, as Allison

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,440
alluded to, I'm the um strategic

61
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
director for the translational and

62
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,120
clinical research at the center for

63
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,480
epilepsy and neurodedevelopmental

64
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,319
disorders, which spans both pen medicine

65
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,400
as well as children's hospital of

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,760
Philadelphia.

67
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,519
But before that, I was a faculty member

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,319
at the University of um at the Columbia

69
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,319
University Medical Center where I was

70
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,480
studying pediatric epilepsies. My

71
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,480
background is in uh developmental

72
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,640
neurobiology, pediatric epilepsy,

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,360
genetics, transcrytoics. Um, and I was

74
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,959
using human pur potent stem cell models,

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
which we'll get into in a minute, as

76
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,760
well as genetic mouse models to study a

77
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,599
number of monogenic

78
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,000
single gene disorders that cause

79
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,799
pediatric epilepsy and autism spectrum

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,560
disorder. Uh, worked on a number of

81
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,239
different developmental and epileptic

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,879
encphylopathies.

83
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,080
And it was actually during this time

84
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,640
that my son Lucas was born with,

85
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,480
strangely enough, a developmental and

86
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,440
epileptic and sephylopathy. He was

87
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
having seizures the day after he was

88
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,599
born. And I had to convince the

89
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,080
neonatlogists on call at the hospital

90
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,480
that he was having seizures. And

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,239
finally, they agreed with me. And at on

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
the second day of life, he was admitted

93
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,680
to the NICU.

94
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:12,560
Every tests um came back negative. now

95
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,680
you know MRI uh uh spinal tap for to

96
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,519
check for u viral infection in the in

97
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,680
the um central nervous system.

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,919
Everything came back except for abnormal

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,440
EEG. And then a couple weeks later we

100
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,800
got the diagnosis that he had a frame

101
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
shift in a gene called STXBP1.

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,680
Um we'll talk a little bit more about

103
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,360
STX BPP1. And I want to use this as kind

104
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,400
of a model system for as I walk you

105
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,360
through how we can develop or use in

106
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,440
vitro tools to develop disease models

107
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,360
that can help predict um pathogenic

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,520
phenotypes as well as response to

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,040
therapies. So I want to first walk you

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,040
through some nomenclature um common

111
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,479
nomenclature that I think will be useful

112
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,880
for you to hear throughout the day. Um

113
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,680
some genetics uh description of

114
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,759
non-neuronal cell lines and and and what

115
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
they're useful for. And then we'll go

116
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,720
into human induced pur potent stem

117
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,199
cells, genomic engineering, and a bunch

118
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,360
of different um methods to to study um

119
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,600
essentially neurons in a dish. And then

120
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,960
we'll I'll give you a real world

121
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,520
application revolved around um STX BP1

122
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,320
modeling in a dish and a gene targeted

123
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,039
therapy to correct some of the deficits

124
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,880
seen in in those cells.

125
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,560
So, I just want to give you a quick

126
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,160
reminder. Most of you probably don't

127
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,440
know what SDXBP1 is. Um, all of you know

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,080
what UB3A is, but SDXBP-1

129
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,320
is expressed in all neurons and it's

130
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,000
absolutely critical for how neurons

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,240
communicate.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
Neurons communicate through

133
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
neurotransmission

134
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,880
mediated by synaptic vesicle release

135
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,759
that goes from one neuron to the next

136
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,800
neuron. in there by initiating the

137
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,000
action potential and um electrical

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,919
propagation and so STX BPP1 is critical

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,240
for release of those synaptic vesicles

140
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,080
uh exocytosis and neurotransmitter

141
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,720
release into the synaptic cleft. So it's

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,280
absolutely critical for communication in

143
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:31,919
the brain.

144
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,520
So as Allison said in the in the opening

145
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,600
there's a couple of different ways that

146
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,880
we can we can develop disease models.

147
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,520
One is in vitro and this is in a in a

148
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,360
most likely a cell line in a dish and we

149
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,600
can manipulate those cells in a number

150
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,720
of different ways. Uh and then there's

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,840
also in vivo and Rodney is going to talk

152
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,520
to you after this about um most likely

153
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,599
about um mouse models of different

154
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,000
diseases. he's he's really terrific at

155
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:08,400
characterizing behavior and whatnot of

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,880
of mouse models of of disease. Um, but

157
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,840
we're going to focus a little bit on in

158
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,479
vitro for the next 15 minutes or so. And

159
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:22,240
so in vitro means just in a dish. We can

160
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:27,360
take cells such as um cells treated with

161
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:30,720
a drug um Angelman syndrome, neurons,

162
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,680
what have you, and study DNA,

163
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,360
mRNA, the UBA

164
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,800
3A protein, that's actually that's the

165
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,960
structure of it down there at the

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,120
bottom. Uh that squiggly thing. Um there

167
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,479
was a Nobel Prize awarded last year for

168
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,639
Alphafold which is a an uh AI method to

169
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,080
predict protein structure which is going

170
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,599
to revolutionize drug discovery

171
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,400
and like I said there a number of things

172
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,039
that we can do with these cell models

173
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,800
and for instance drug screening treating

174
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,960
them with drugs different anti-sense

175
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,199
oligouonucleotides

176
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,800
um we can look at cellular morphology

177
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,280
through high content imaging and and um

178
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,199
and also look at metabolic profiling to

179
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,319
to see how the metabolism of neurons or

180
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
or cell types affected by disorder are

181
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,120
are changed and are different from

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,720
control cell lines.

183
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,560
So going way back to the basics, you

184
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,640
know that you have two sets of

185
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,680
chromosomes, one set from your mother,

186
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,080
one set from your father. Each one of

187
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,720
those gameamtes had 23 chromosomes and

188
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,160
when they combine to form the embryo you

189
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,640
now you have 46 chromosomes and that's

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,720
called diploid.

191
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,040
Another

192
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,720
technical term scientific term that

193
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:03,440
you'll probably hear is transfection.

194
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,440
This is moving DNA into a cell using a

195
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
nonviral means like a lipid nano

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,920
particle which you'll probably also hear

197
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,000
about today. And there's also

198
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,920
transduction and this is the process by

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,680
which viruses enter a cell to to deliver

200
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,680
a cargo such as mRNA or DNA.

201
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,399
So, some of the more common cell lines

202
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,920
that people use

203
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,160
are actually pretty terrible because if

204
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,120
you look at each one of these cell

205
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,040
lines, whether it's the human embryionic

206
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,160
kidney, the epithelial cancer, Hila,

207
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,080
um the retinal pigmented epithelium, or

208
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,040
the neuroblastoma cell line that I've

209
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,959
indicated here,

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,959
look at the number of chromosomes here.

211
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,080
They're highly annoyed. These are

212
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:00,160
essentially cancer in a dish. And so

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,000
these don't represent very good cell

214
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,839
models of disease, but they do have

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,680
their utility because they're very easy

216
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,399
to work with. They're easily

217
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,519
transfectable and you can use them in

218
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,079
really high throughput to screen tens of

219
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,160
thousands of drugs. This is one of the

220
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,480
first steps you would use a cell line

221
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,519
such as this to give you an indication

222
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,480
that for instance um if you're screening

223
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,839
an anti-sense oligouonucleotide or some

224
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,160
small molecule or even virally delivered

225
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,120
genes whether or not this is going to

226
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,959
have an effect in uh a real disease

227
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,440
model

228
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,760
but these like I said these aren't

229
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,399
typically used for disease modeling

230
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,399
because they're in incredibly artificial

231
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,399
In 2007, Shina Yamanaka published a

232
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,399
paper where they took adult fiber

233
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,279
blasts. So just a fiber blast um taken

234
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,880
from a skin punch biopsy grown out in

235
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,240
culture and they were able to revert

236
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:11,440
that cell type from a from an adult

237
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,160
person back into what resembled it human

238
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,920
embryionic stem cell. That's a stem

239
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,160
cell. It's a fleeting um sulfate very

240
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,399
early in in development. These

241
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,560
embryionic stem cells give rise to every

242
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,440
cell type in the body, the entire embryo

243
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:32,480
proper. He won the Nobel Prize for this

244
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:36,320
discovery in 2012. And this became um

245
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,160
the de facto way to start to generate

246
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,760
and look at purip potent stem cells

247
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,240
because you didn't have to destroy an

248
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,839
embryo to derive them. You could take

249
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,880
dermal fiberblasts or um monucleiated

250
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:51,440
cells from the blood and apply these

251
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,920
viruses that contain these reprogramming

252
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,000
factors and turn these back into what's

253
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,480
called a humaninduced pur potent stem

254
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,200
cell which is also able to give rise to

255
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,760
all cell types in an adult organism. And

256
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,000
you can take these cells and using small

257
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,200
molecules and other and other proteins

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,440
and whatnot that mimic um that that

259
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
mimic the developmental cascades that

260
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
give rise to different cell types and

261
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
germ layers.

262
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,240
You can generate a number of different

263
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,680
cell types muscle, heart, pancreas, you

264
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,079
what have you. We can also generate all

265
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,639
the cell types in the brain for instance

266
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:34,320
neurons or aststerytes. And uh these pur

267
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:38,000
potent stem cells these IPS cells were

268
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,480
proven to be biochemically

269
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,399
equivalent to embryionic stem cells when

270
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,959
a group that I was involved with at

271
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,560
Scripps Research uh were able to clone

272
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,519
mice using these cells. So demonstrating

273
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,079
that they they truly can give rise to

274
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,160
any uh cell type in the body because we

275
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:59,920
we cloned mice that were fertile and

276
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,760
could and and could breed and whatnot.

277
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,000
So there are a few different ways to

278
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:08,320
make these IPS cells. Um all involve

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
that that reprogramming using those

280
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,399
reprogramming factors. But there are

281
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,120
some different models that that we

282
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,519
should consider. So this is a trio or a

283
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,240
familial model where most of you have

284
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,440
had whole exom sequencing done. And when

285
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,200
they do that, if they're looking for a

286
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,560
denovo mutation, they take um they take

287
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,040
your genomic DNA, your spouse's genomic

288
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
DNA and your child's genomic DNA and

289
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,800
they sequence it and that's called a

290
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,720
trio. And then they use the information

291
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,519
there to to see what what's different

292
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,120
between your child and you uh for denovo

293
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,720
mutations. So in this case we've derived

294
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:51,360
IPS cells from a mother, a father and an

295
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:54,880
infant with a neurological disorder.

296
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,959
So the IPS cells derived from each of

297
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,560
these people

298
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,000
represent

299
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,160
essentially them in a dish. So the IPS

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,800
cells with the from the child with a

301
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,519
neurological disorder will differentiate

302
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,160
into neurons that harbor the genetic

303
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,040
defects and physiological defects

304
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,639
pertinent to that mutation.

305
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,760
Another

306
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:26,639
way to um model use these IPS cells is

307
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,120
uh isogenic model. And this just means

308
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,839
the same gene. Isogenic means the same

309
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,399
genome. And so the way to do this is you

310
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,480
take the uh you generate IPS cells from

311
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
an infant with a with a neurological

312
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,320
disorder or any disorder for that matter

313
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,920
and then you can use genomic engineering

314
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,680
such as crisper cast 9 to correct that

315
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,279
mutation.

316
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,000
And

317
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,639
now you have a corrected isogenic

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,959
control line that you can compare to the

319
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,720
to the mutant line. And the only

320
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,000
theoretically the only difference

321
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,199
between these two is the mutation that's

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,320
found in the in the proband.

323
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:11,519
Similarly, we can also take an

324
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,360
unaffected iPS cell line, say say an iPS

325
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,680
cell line generated from me or you and

326
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,120
use gen again use genomic engineering,

327
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,480
but this time to knock different

328
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,800
mutations into that cell line so that we

329
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,160
can study the effect of different

330
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,519
mutations of the same gene

331
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,760
on the same genetic background.

332
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:38,160
This is this is an incredibly powerful

333
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:41,440
technology because so much of what

334
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,000
makes us us are

335
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,639
driven by genetic modifiers that modify

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,959
disease phenotype which is why we have

337
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,839
heterogeneity in our patient populations

338
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,040
genetic modifiers.

339
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:01,040
So these IPS cells, as I alluded to, can

340
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,040
be differentiated into neurons using

341
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,560
small molecules and proteins that mimic

342
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,000
developmental um morphagen gradients in

343
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,480
different regions of the brain. Um, it

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,399
goes through a a a timed series of

345
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
events that go through neural rosettes

346
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,800
which mimic development of the

347
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,040
embryionic neural tube into neural stem

348
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,440
cells that give rise into progenitors

349
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,279
that differentiate into immature neurons

350
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,160
and then you get more mature neuronal

351
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
networks that in the dish can talk to

352
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,040
each other and we can measure their

353
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,120
activity.

354
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,680
Another way to do this is to forcibly

355
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,480
overexpress a a a gene called a

356
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,320
transcription factor that is involved in

357
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,920
cell fate decisions. In this case, it's

358
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,639
NGN2.

359
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,959
And when you express NGN2 in an IPS

360
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,360
cell, you skip all of this development

361
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,639
and you go basically right to the

362
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,600
neurons. So in a dish, this saves you

363
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:01,120
time and money.

364
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,720
And then the third way that is probably

365
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,839
the most commonly used now the NGN2 and

366
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,839
these organoids or spheroids. Um the

367
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,720
organoids or spheroids are are are

368
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,480
similar to um a naturally occurring

369
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,480
developmental model in in three

370
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,240
dimensions. Sometimes you'll hear this

371
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
referred to as mini brains and that's

372
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,640
definitely not the case. These these

373
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,360
don't have consciousness or anything

374
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,520
like that. Um, but it's a

375
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,000
three-dimensional representation of of

376
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,880
brain development in a dish and it it's

377
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,039
incredibly powerful. We can even derive

378
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
organoids from different regions of the

379
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,200
brain. For instance, this CO is a

380
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,000
cortical organoid. So the dorsal

381
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,480
forbrain versus the mgo which is the

382
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,360
medial gangleionic eminence which is a

383
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,440
region in in the um in the center of the

384
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,440
brain where certain neurons called

385
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,840
gabberurgic interneurons or inhibitory

386
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,440
neurons come from. And that's a huge

387
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
interplay in the brain in brain

388
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,320
development.

389
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,039
So when thinking about which type of

390
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,880
model you want to develop for a given

391
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,960
disorder, you need to think about the

392
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,799
biology of the disorder of the gene that

393
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320
you're studying and then you go for an

394
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,280
appropriately

395
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,880
um an appropriate model based on what

396
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,039
you want to get out of that. Um

397
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,880
organoids are are tricky. they they

398
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,919
generally take about four months to get

399
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,240
good neuronal activity. Um you can you

400
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,240
can get similar activity from NGN2

401
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,720
cultures in in less time. Um it's it's

402
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,120
just the each one has pros and cons and

403
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,760
the scientist will will decide which

404
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,600
which is best for their model. But let's

405
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,720
talk about cortical organoids.

406
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,240
You can make hundreds if not thousands

407
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,160
of these in a couple of hours.

408
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,960
And they're tiny. They look like tiny

409
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,080
little balls of cells the next day. And

410
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,840
then they just grow over time into about

411
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,039
a little bit smaller than the size of a

412
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:06,160
pee um after four or five months. And

413
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,840
when the brain is developing

414
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,320
during very early embryionic

415
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,320
development, it's built in an inside out

416
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:17,200
fashion where these re very early radial

417
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,919
ga cells divide into these intermediate

418
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,840
progenitors that then divide into a

419
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,080
different type of cell called an outer

420
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:29,280
radial ga that extends this this really

421
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,919
long armor process all the way up to the

422
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,280
top of the developing brain. And the

423
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,039
immature neurons that that divide out

424
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,840
from these outer radia cells crawl up

425
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:45,520
these processes to their specific

426
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,799
genetically determined, temporally and

427
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:53,600
spatially determined place in the brain

428
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:56,000
and newborn neurons stop, other ones

429
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,400
crawl past them, stop and then it's so

430
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,160
on and built like that. And we can use

431
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,960
different uh markers of cell types to

432
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,400
track which of these track these cell

433
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,080
types. For instance, the deep layer

434
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,400
neurons you see have a gene called TBR1

435
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,200
expressed or CTIP 2. Whereas the

436
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,039
superficial or top layer neurons have

437
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,799
BRN2 or SAT BP2. And during organoid

438
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,480
development, we can actually track to

439
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,280
see that this is faithfully

440
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,919
recapitulated. And it is. We start with

441
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,480
these early neuronal progenitors that

442
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,159
then start to give rise to deep layer

443
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,080
neurons

444
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,640
that then give rise to uh gabaurgic

445
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,880
progenitors, excitatory neuron

446
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,039
progenitors. And finally after 3 or 4

447
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,440
months we get highly synaptically

448
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,640
organized neuronal networks within the

449
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:54,799
organoid that hopefully the organoid

450
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,600
contains the cell types that we want.

451
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,919
But not all organoids are created equal.

452
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,520
In the developing brain there in the

453
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
developing cortex, there are two

454
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
neuronal subtypes that are incredibly

455
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,320
important and their interplay is very

456
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,640
important. These are excitatory neurons

457
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,840
that mediate most of the and these

458
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,000
respond to glutamate the

459
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,200
neurotransmitter glutamate. These were

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,840
these um

461
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,000
these are the main excitatory output

462
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,720
sensory output from from the uh

463
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,640
developing cortex and then you have the

464
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,760
inhibitory neurons which are there to

465
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,520
kind of put the brake on the excitatory

466
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:34,880
neurons and make sure they're not too

467
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,919
excitable. Um there's a lot of things

468
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,720
that can go wrong in these interactions

469
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:46,320
which result in hyperexitability which

470
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:48,159
is uh attributed to epilepsy. Um

471
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,840
this this interaction between these cell

472
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,919
types is extremely complicated. There

473
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,240
was a paper that just came out that in

474
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,320
the in the developing mouse cortex,

475
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,720
there are there are thousands of

476
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,799
different types of inhibitory neurons

477
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,200
that all have different functions on

478
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,760
regulating the activity of excitatory

479
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,640
neurons. And so there are a number of

480
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,559
different ways to make these organoids

481
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,880
using different protocols from different

482
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,440
labs. And what I want you to appreciate

483
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,360
here is that the developing neoortex has

484
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,440
about 25% inhibitory neurons.

485
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,960
If you look at some of these protocols

486
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,679
here, the inhibitory neurons are

487
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,159
replicate are are indicated by or the

488
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,520
the percentage of inhibitory neurons is

489
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,840
is indicated by the the green pi in the

490
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,679
in the pie chart. And you can see that

491
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,880
some of these protocols pretty

492
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,679
faithfully recapitulate what you see in

493
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,200
the developing neoortex whereas some

494
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:48,559
like the biradal have hardly any

495
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,240
gabberurgic inter neurons. Well, I'm

496
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,559
interested in sdxbp1 which regulates how

497
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,280
excitatory and inhibitory neurons

498
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,880
communicate. So, I want to use a

499
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,000
protocol that makes an organoid that

500
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:08,000
contains the cell types that I need to

501
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,400
study the intricacies of the neuronal

502
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,400
network and how the neurons can actually

503
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
communicate.

504
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:22,240
Again, not all organoids are are

505
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,880
equal even using the same protocols.

506
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:29,200
This is data from from uh my lab at

507
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:32,640
Colombia where we took IPS cells and

508
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,760
their controls made organoids from from

509
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,799
different cell lines and we looked at

510
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,640
their morphology or how they look and

511
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:46,799
their activity and you can see that on

512
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,640
the left those are beautiful organoids.

513
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:50,799
Yes, I'm a nerd. That's a beautiful

514
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,280
organoid.

515
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,360
The ones in the middle, not so good.

516
00:23:53,280 --> 00:24:00,080
This is at 18 days. At 18 days, very

517
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,159
early in their development, they start

518
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,400
to form these blebs that are almost

519
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,799
reminiscent of embryionic yolk like

520
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,960
structures, and then they just implode

521
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:14,080
and die. And on the far right, we again,

522
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,840
we have nice, beautiful organoids, but

523
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,520
when we go to measure their electrical

524
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,279
activity, they're largely inert. So,

525
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,279
there's this trade-off. You want

526
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,480
something that has really nice

527
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:29,520
morphology and structure, but also you

528
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,840
want something that has a a good

529
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,440
activity profile, electrical activity

530
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,159
profile that you can measure.

531
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,000
So let's get into the application in the

532
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,039
last few minutes of the talk and and see

533
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,520
how you can try to put all of these

534
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,240
different in vitro tools together to

535
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,880
model a disorder and develop a gene

536
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,559
targeted therapy.

537
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,919
So obviously when Lucas was born I made

538
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:03,279
IPS cells from him. That's what I do. Um

539
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:05,760
and from me and my wife. My wife's IPS

540
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:09,760
cells were terrible at making organoids,

541
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,840
which I like to point out often. Um,

542
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,440
mine mine were really mine were really

543
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,919
good, actually.

544
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,640
Um, so the first thing we did was we we

545
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:24,000
differentiated these IPS cells into just

546
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,320
2D neurons in a dish because I wanted to

547
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,240
see if the the neurons themselves

548
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,240
recapitulated what we thought was going

549
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,320
on with Lucas's mutation, which is a

550
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,240
frame shift or a protein truncating

551
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,840
variant. So he should have hlo

552
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,200
insufficiency and about a 50% reduction

553
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,840
of STX BPP1 protein. And so we did that.

554
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,960
We differentiated these in a dish and

555
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:52,159
after about 65 days or two two months in

556
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,120
in a dish. We harvested the protein from

557
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:57,919
the from the neurons and we checked the

558
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,720
expression levels of STX BPP1 and as

559
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:04,559
expected Lucas's

560
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,760
neurons contain about 50% less STX BP1

561
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:12,080
than than my neurons.

562
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,320
So then we decided let's let's go after

563
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,679
an organoid model and I won't go into

564
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:20,400
all of the deta details and and data

565
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,559
that we acrewed over time developing

566
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,320
this organoid model but I'll show you

567
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,600
some of the activity measurements and

568
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,600
and how they um how they relate to gene

569
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,200
therapy development.

570
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,960
So,

571
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,559
this is uh a a a blowup of a single

572
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,600
organoid,

573
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,919
again, probably about half the size of a

574
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,880
pee at about four months old. And this

575
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,400
is one of Lucas's organoids. And I'm

576
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,600
going to play this movie and I want you

577
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,320
to appreciate the activity within the

578
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,799
organoid. So, you're going to see a big

579
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,159
bright flash, which is a synchronized

580
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:03,120
activity. Um, synchronous oscillations

581
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,919
are um, common in these closed loop

582
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,919
systems like an organoid. And you'll see

583
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,480
a big bright flash and then you'll see

584
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,279
some little blips in these highlighted

585
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,360
circles. You'll see big bright flashes

586
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:18,400
periodically. And that's these these

587
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,440
synchronous oscillations.

588
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:25,279
So big bright flash, a little blip, and

589
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,799
then you'll see another blip right here.

590
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,640
and then more of these synchronous

591
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,080
oscillations.

592
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:36,000
So, we can actually measure this and

593
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,200
start to quantify this and we could see

594
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,679
activity pattern differences between

595
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,799
Lucas' organoids and the control

596
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,840
organoids. For instance, you can already

597
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:52,240
tell that these

598
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:56,720
these bursts in Lucas's organoids are

599
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,760
wider and they have more more um spikes

600
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,240
within the organ within the within the

601
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,880
burst compared to the control. And as

602
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,679
well as these these bursts

603
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,600
are timed differently. There's more

604
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,120
space in between them. They're they're

605
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,360
longer. The bursts are longer. there's

606
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,880
more sp time in between them. So these

607
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,679
are all characteristics that we can use

608
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:26,559
to try to modulate with gene therapies.

609
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:30,320
So I'm very interested in therapies that

610
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,840
modulate how genes are expressed whether

611
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,520
they be uh anti-sense

612
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,640
oligoucleucleotides

613
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,039
or using an adaptation of genetic

614
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,039
engineering crisper cast 9 system called

615
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,840
crisper A. So this is a cast 9 protein

616
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,559
that should be able to cut DNA for the

617
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,039
editing uh purposes that I talked about

618
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:55,440
earlier, but the the act the um active

619
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,960
site of the protein has been mutated. So

620
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,480
it can't cut DNA. But you can still hone

621
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,919
this protein to anywhere in the genome

622
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,440
because it binds these little pieces of

623
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,679
RNA that are complmentary to different

624
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,399
places in the genome. So if you can find

625
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,679
these little RNAs for instance in the

626
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,399
STX BP1 gene regulatory elements like

627
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,320
the gene promoter, you can hone this

628
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,080
cast 9 protein to that region. Cast 9

629
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,520
itself isn't going to do anything. So

630
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:32,880
you need to add uh what's called a

631
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:35,200
transcriptional activation domain. This

632
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,159
brings in the machinery that helps

633
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,640
upregulate gene transcription from that

634
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,440
promoter. So using this crisper

635
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,000
activation technology,

636
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,600
we can upregulate or should be able to

637
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,399
upregulate STX BP1 mRNA that's then

638
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,200
translated into protein correcting HLO

639
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,720
insufficiency.

640
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,039
And

641
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:03,120
we first screened a number of these

642
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,679
different guide RNAs in the shitty cell

643
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,320
lines that I told you about earlier, HEC

644
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,559
293T and the neuroblastoma cell line

645
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,080
because they're easy, they're quick. Uh

646
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,200
you you can get a lot of information

647
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,440
quickly and we we found that to our

648
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,240
surprise almost all of our guide RNAs

649
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
were very effective at upregulating STX

650
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:28,000
BP1 expression.

651
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,559
So we took uh our crisper cast 9

652
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:35,440
uh crisper a

653
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:38,640
AAV virus and we transduced

654
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,440
organoids at about about 3mon-old

655
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,919
organoids with this virus that should be

656
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:50,399
able to correct HLO insufficiency.

657
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,200
And after about 2 weeks, 2 to 3 weeks,

658
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,080
we harvested RNA and DNA and tested

659
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,399
whether or not the STX BP1 protein and

660
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,919
RNA levels were corrected. And indeed,

661
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:04,720
they were. So in Lucas' organoids, we've

662
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:09,520
essentially reestablished the the normal

663
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:13,360
level of STX BP-1 expression.

664
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,840
What does that do to the physiological

665
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,159
defects that we identified in the in the

666
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,799
organoid, you know, the flashing movies?

667
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,799
Well, some of these those little blips

668
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,520
that you that I called your attention

669
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,320
to, those low amplitude events we think

670
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:31,279
are microcircuit defects potentially in

671
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,320
um related to uh epilepsy phenotypes.

672
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,120
And we showed that the crisper A virus

673
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,159
could actually reduce the incidence of

674
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,880
those low amplitude events thereby

675
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,640
potentially correcting that defect in

676
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,919
the organoids.

677
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,440
Moreover, if you look at a a number of

678
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,080
different cells on the Y ais, in this

679
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,279
case, hundreds of cells, and then over

680
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,200
time, what you can get is a picture of

681
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,720
activity

682
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,720
um in the organoid. And so those bursts

683
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,440
that I showed you earlier in the in the

684
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,200
colorful diagrams can be depicted by

685
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,960
these by these lines that go um up and

686
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,039
down on this what's called a raster

687
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,080
plot. So you can see in the control you

688
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:19,679
have very thin bursts in the whole

689
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,760
organoid. These are the synchronized

690
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,320
oscillations and and in the in Lucas's

691
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,720
organoids again the bursts are wider the

692
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,399
the dark lines are thicker and there's a

693
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,760
different spacing. They're in general

694
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,480
further apart. If we apply the crisper a

695
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,760
virus we can start to correct that. the

696
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,159
bursts shorten, the interbururst or the

697
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,799
time in between bursts begins to

698
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,200
shorten, indicating that we're starting

699
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:49,840
to have positive effects on the

700
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,200
neurohysiology of these organoids with a

701
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,679
geneargeted therapy. And so this is one

702
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,960
very powerful uh application of in vitro

703
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:05,120
models for developing and testing gene

704
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,919
targeted therapies in a disease relevant

705
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,679
clinically relevant model

706
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:15,120
and

707
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:17,760
fast leaves no stone unturned. They've

708
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,039
funded work that is involved in using

709
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:25,679
the crispercast 9 gene editing function

710
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:29,559
to essentially just chew up the UBA

711
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,559
anti-sense transcript.

712
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,519
There's another group that used a very

713
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,480
clever method to actually

714
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,480
um

715
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:45,679
turn off the anti-sense transcript by

716
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,679
methylating the region by by using

717
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,480
epigenetic modifiers that will methylate

718
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,640
a certain region that turns off the

719
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,880
anti-sense transcript thereby

720
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,919
upregulating the paternal UB3A. a

721
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:06,159
transcript. And then I think just last

722
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:09,119
year um FAST has also um doubled down on

723
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:12,960
a on a crisper activation technology

724
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,560
similar to what I what I described to um

725
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,440
hopefully

726
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,839
meet uh a therapeutic potential for for

727
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
the deletion genotype.

728
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:23,919
With that,

729
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,839
I'll stop. Thank some colleagues from

730
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:35,159
Colombia and the end team at Penn and

731
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:35,159
Chop. And I'm only slightly past time.

732
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,119
>> Thank you so much.

733
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,520
>> Okay.

734
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,240
>> Thank you so much.

735
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,960
So, as you can see, that's really

736
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,839
complicated and it's hard to make that

737
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,679
simple because it's not. But what I want

738
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,639
you to realize is that when everyone's

739
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,399
like, "Why is this taking so long, you

740
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,359
need to do all of that, which can take

741
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:01,520
years before you can ever even put it

742
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,680
into an animal to test if it has the

743
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,200
potential and the possibility of even

744
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,680
working. So our next talk is to talk to

745
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,480
us about putting it into an animal to

746
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,800
show us the possibility of how it might

747
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,200
work, which gets a little bit more

748
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,720
simple as we go closer and closer to

749
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,560
humans." So I know that was a lot. I

750
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,960
know that was complicated, but you can

751
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,040
see the elegance and the beauty of the

752
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,440
science and that's why things take a

753
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,119
long time and cost a lot of money. One

754
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,119
thing I just want to highlight is that I

755
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,079
was told the QR code for translations in

756
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,079
the brochure is not working. So, they're

757
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,680
putting a new QR code on every table.

758
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,520
So, if you need translations, just use

759
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,800
the new QR code to get your

760
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,480
translations. We want to make sure

761
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,480
everybody can hear and understand.
