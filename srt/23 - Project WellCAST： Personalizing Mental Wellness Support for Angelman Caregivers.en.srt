1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
So, our next speaker is Dr. Bridget

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,279
Keller, and she's going to be talking to

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,240
us about Project Wellcast, p

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,519
personalizing mental um well wellness

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000
support for Angelman Syndrome

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,759
caregivers, which we all desperately

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,759
need. So, if somebody can help

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,080
personalize my mental wellness, that

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,080
would be great.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,360
[Applause]

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,480
All right, where are the caregivers in

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,840
the room? Yay. Yay. Okay, give

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,920
yourselves a round of applause for

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,520
staying this long in the day. Okay, so

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,440
this one is for you. I won't talk about

16
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,280
any animal models, I promise. Um, so I

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,600
am going to share with you today results

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,480
of a recent very large clinical trial

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,719
that we conducted to understand more

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,800
about how to support caregivers. The

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,680
original pilot data for this project was

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,840
actually funded by ASF in 2019. So all

23
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,160
of this started with Angelman syndrome

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,840
and I want to underscore that. So the

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
goal of our trial was to try to

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,160
understand how we could match caregivers

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,760
of people with rare genetic conditions

28
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,439
to personalize 100% remote support that

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,840
would actually meet their unique family

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
needs. So a lot of times when you roll

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
into your local clinic or you see

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,880
somebody online, they're thinking about

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,799
two things in terms of what to support

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,400
you with. One is what are your mental

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,240
health needs? Do you kind of exceed the

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,840
threshold on this on the checklist,

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,840
right? And the other is what's

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
available. But we know that especially

39
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,600
for rare families and especially for

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,159
Angelmen families, a lot else is going

41
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
on. You might have, you know, compared

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,079
to other families who are showing up at

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,240
that clinic, different feelings about

44
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
Angelmen syndrome. You might have a

45
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,880
child who has different needs. You have

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,400
different levels of existing care. And

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,159
you might have different forms of other

48
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
treatments available to you, different

49
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,240
cultural factors and values, different

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
social support, caregiving stage, you

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,439
know, have you been doing this for

52
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,759
decades or is it a new diagnosis,

53
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,119
personality differences, lifestyle,

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,880
time, literacy, respit care, lots and

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,560
lots and lots of things. Um, and we

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,240
actually are measuring all of this now.

57
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,399
And we're trying to understand how do we

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,240
take not just your score, but the

59
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,840
topography of your life to figure out

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
what you need.

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,480
So, how did we do this? Um, so we

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,280
received about $3 million from NIH who

63
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,520
really cares about this issue to try to

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,280
develop a precision health tool or an

65
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
algorithm. And when I say algorithm, I

66
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,160
don't mean AI. I mean a, you know, a

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,400
decision tree that clinicians, policy

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,800
leaders, PAGS can use to help figure out

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
what to offer their families. So, the

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
first step of this was to design an

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,400
algorithm. And to do this, we use two

72
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,000
primary forms of data. So when families

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
come into the study, they provide two

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,319
weeks of data collection. One is your

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,560
standard self report questionnaires that

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
you've done millions of, right? Um the

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,800
other is innovative. It's ecological

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,480
momentary assessment where we pinged

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,239
caregivers smartphones as they went

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,760
about their days and asked about all of

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,239
those things I just showed you on the

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,080
other screen. Together, we formed a

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,800
clinical decision tree that matched what

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,720
we know just from science alone on what

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
treatments and support programs that are

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,920
typically available in communities,

87
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
things like acceptance and commitment

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,680
therapy or peer-to-peer coaching, which

89
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,879
of these things might best fit

90
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,480
caregivers with various unique profiles.

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,080
We knew we would not get this right, and

92
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,360
we told NIH that we were going to be

93
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
wrong. And I'm very glad they still

94
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
funded us. And the reason they did that

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,959
is we told them as we went through this

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
trial, we would test and refine the

97
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
algorithm. To to do this, we had a

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
community academic partnership that was

99
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,519
really incredible. We hired eight rare

100
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,879
disorder caregiver coaches who worked on

101
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,480
our team, deployed some of the

102
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,959
treatments, helped us figure out how to

103
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,440
fix our algorithm, and they also worked

104
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,200
with over 50 trainees across the United

105
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,879
States and New Zealand who offered the

106
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,480
treatments to caregivers. So, it also

107
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,200
functioned as this great training

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
program for next generation clinicians.

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,120
So all of these folks would then deploy

110
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,560
the algorithm to the f the people in the

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
trial. Half were assigned to the

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,040
algorithm. Half were assigned to a more

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,959
random treatment. Um and then we looked

114
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,920
at what worked.

115
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
To do that, we developed a a a protocol

116
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,920
that we now called cascade paneling. So

117
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
this is a new model and I'm sharing the

118
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,480
the publication here in case anybody

119
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,640
wants to learn more about it. Um to make

120
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,400
clinically informed decisions alongside

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,920
community partners in research settings.

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,479
So we essentially looked at the data

123
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
together and we had preset criteria for

124
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,320
how we would fix the algorithm based on

125
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,880
what the data looked like. And we did

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,639
that three times. So across the last

127
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,479
four semesters, this happened very

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,160
quickly. We tried three different

129
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
versions of this algorithm that we

130
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,919
refined based on the data in the trial

131
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,600
and caregiver input. So I'll just show

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,040
you a few results and then I would love

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,400
for you to see us at posters. I think we

134
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
have like five posters out there, so

135
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,199
come visit us. Uh we enrolled over 400

136
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,800
families. 64 of those were Angelmen

137
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
caregivers which we were so excited to

138
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
see. They were across the US and across

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,000
this protocol the families received a

140
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
lot of support over 1,400 coaching

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
sessions. So part of this I won't talk

142
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
about today is we also looked at peer

143
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
coaching as a method for boosting

144
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,320
engagement in clinical trials. This is

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
something I would love to talk with

146
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,639
industry partners about in particular.

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,759
Um, and so people got coaching, but they

148
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,600
also got over 2400 hours of free therapy

149
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
and support programs deployed by these

150
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,560
excellent graduate student trainees. We

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,639
collected a lot of data, over 80,000 of

152
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,000
those smartphone surveys across four

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
semesters. And then we also had

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,560
self-report forms and some additional

155
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,280
behavioral data I won't share here.

156
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,520
What did we find? The study was feasible

157
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,280
over we hit our 80% metric over and

158
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,199
over. So this model of doing everything

159
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,120
remotely from assessment to treatment

160
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,039
and partnering with these clinical

161
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
graduate students and these amazing peer

162
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,880
coaches worked. The families showed up

163
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
and the next step is they found it

164
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,560
acceptable. Um we actually had to

165
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
develop a new acceptability tool for

166
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,400
this trial because nothing quite existed

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
that looked at both the program and the

168
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
context and whether it mattered to

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
caregivers. So if you want to learn more

170
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,360
about that, we've published it. Um, but

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
according to the threshold of this tool,

172
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
91% of participants, regardless of

173
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,280
whether they got their first choice

174
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,520
treatment, found the program to be

175
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,919
acceptable. And then finally, it was

176
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,600
feasible. We hit our 80% threshold for

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,199
feasibility across all of the different

178
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,199
outcomes. Oh, wait, I'm going backwards.

179
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
Um, we also found that it was

180
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,400
efficacious. So, depression is moving

181
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,759
across the treatment. We'll be

182
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,840
publishing more about this in the

183
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,680
future. Um, and we are also able to look

184
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,240
at those more innovative kind of uh,

185
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
ecological surveys to see outcomes and

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
those are showing us different sources

187
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
of information. So that'll be a preview

188
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,880
to next year. Um, but huge thanks to the

189
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,600
big team that made this happen including

190
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,000
the investigators, the staff, uh, the

191
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,000
peer coaches and all of the trainees.

192
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,520
Um, and check out our posters. And I

193
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
also wanted to mention we offer a free

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,800
webinar series where we just take one

195
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,319
little piece of data from this and share

196
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,680
it back with families every month. It's

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
super fun and we would love to have you

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,090

199
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:51,680
learn more. Thanks.

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,800
