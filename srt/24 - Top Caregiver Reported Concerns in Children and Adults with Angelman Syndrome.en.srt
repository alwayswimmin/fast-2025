1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
Our next speaker is uh Maline Graming

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,799
from Boston Children's Hospital um

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,639
talking about top caregiver reported

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,360
concerns in children and adults living

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,360
with Angelmen syndrome.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,039
Whoops.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,720
Hey. Hi everyone. My name is Maddie. I'm

8
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,080
a coordinator working with the Angelman

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,000
Syndrome Clinical Research Group at

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
Boston Children's Hospital and I'm going

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
to be giving a brief overview of our

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440
research looking at top caregiver

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,160
concerns reported uh for children and

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
adults with Angelman Syndrome.

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,920
I'll start by giving some background on

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,079
our project. First, we know that all

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,079
challenges and experiences within the AS

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,840
community are unique and may vary upon

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,559
an individual's age and molecular

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,840
subtype. The caregiver perspective is

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,079
crucial for understanding their

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,680
day-to-day challenges and concerns, and

23
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,359
insight into these concerns could

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,800
potentially help to guide interventions

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,640
and policies for individuals with AS.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,400
Our aims for this project are to

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,880
evaluate common developmental,

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,520
behavioral, medical, and other concerns

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,840
reported by caregivers, identify the

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,640
major reported concerns by caregivers of

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,280
individuals as with AS based on their

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,360
molecular subtype and their age, and to

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,680
use those caregiver reported concerns to

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,600
identify areas of unmet need as well as

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,360
gaps in care in the community.

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,119
Um, the data for this project were

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,680
collected as part of the AS natural

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,360
history study. At annual study visits,

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,439
caregivers participate in an interview

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
with the study team during which they're

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,759
prompted to give their top three

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
concerns for their loved one with AS.

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
They're given the option to rank these

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
concerns on a scale of one to three with

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,000
one being their greatest concern. These

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,680
are responses are recorded on a form by

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
the study team where they're either

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,280
listed as part of a pre-established

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,159
category or entered as a free text

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,000
concern under other. After our initial

51
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,159
data collection and during review of

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,159
this data set, we recoded all these free

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,640
text concerns to either fit into one of

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
the pre-existing categories or we

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,800
created new categories that would

56
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,120
capture these data. We ended up with a

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,599
final 23 concern categories to analyze

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,120
which we analyzed in the following ways.

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,120
First, we looked at the percentage of

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,200
caregivers who reported each concern

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,760
regardless of how they chose to end rank

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,599
or endorse that concern. We then took a

63
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,560
closer look at just the number one

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,599
concern um and analyze those concerns by

65
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
both age and molecular subtype.

66
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,120
Now, a quick look at our sample. We

67
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,959
included uh data from 193 unique

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,239
participants in the AS natural history

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,160
study. For analyses, we split uh our

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,800
sample up into four age cohorts

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,879
represented here. As you can see, uh the

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,480
most predominant cohort was individuals

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,879
in the um age 6 to 12 years cohort. Um

74
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,640
and then for our subtype breakdown, um

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,959
as expected, the majority of our sample

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,920
was deletion positive, followed by those

77
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,959
with a UB3A mutation and then UPD and

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,440
imprinting defects.

79
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,920
Right. Um here is a quick look at some

80
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,200
of our results. Shown here is our graph

81
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,120
uh representing the percentage of

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
caregivers who reported each concern

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,040
regardless of how they chose to rank

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,280
that concern. The list of concerns on

85
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
the left hand side um are the 23

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,360
categories that we came up with after we

87
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,239
did our recoding and then we further

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,120
collapsed overlapping categories. Uh in

89
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,120
this figure um the greater represented

90
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,879
concerns and more frequently reported

91
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200
concerns are represented by the longer

92
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,720
bars um as well as the darker red color.

93
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,640
And it's clear from looking at these

94
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,480
results that the most commonly reported

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,879
concern was expressive communication in

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,799
our sample. Uh this was followed by

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,360
externalizing behaviors which are things

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,680
like hitting and slapping um as well as

99
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
sleep. But we do still see um

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,000
endorsement and representation of those

101
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
concerns across all of our domains. We

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,360
did take this a step further and analyze

103
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,000
concerns within age cohorts and

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
molecular subtype. Um those data will be

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,959
shown on our poster in the session

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,480
following this. So, please, if you're

107
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,040
interested, feel free to come and check

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,799
those out.

109
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,239
And to wrap this up, um, I'm just going

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
to share some of our key takeaways from

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,080
what we've learned so far. Um, first, as

112
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
I've already mentioned, expressive

113
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
communication was by far, uh, the most

114
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,120
frequently reported caregiver concern in

115
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,440
our sample. Um, identifying those key

116
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,840
concerns for individuals with AS across

117
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,000
various life stages and across genetic

118
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,479
subtypes supports a more targeted

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,240
person- centered approach to care. and

120
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,919
the caregiver voice is critical for

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,000
advancing treatments and support

122
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,240
services that specifically address the

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
most pressing needs of the AS community.

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,160
Um, and I'll just wrap up by giving a

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,840
quick thank you to the ABOM, um, to all

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,600
the investigators and study teams that

127
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,960
are part of the natural history study

128
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
and of course to all of our wonderful

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,250
families who have contributed to this

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,860
data. So, thank you.

131
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,860
[Applause]

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,040
I love seeing the opportunity of all

133
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
these research coordinators and students

134
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,960
that are coming up here and presenting

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,680
to this ent enormous audience. It's so

136
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,600
impressive to see these young academic

137
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
researchers really getting involved and

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,680
caring enough to put this together and

139
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,680
present to
