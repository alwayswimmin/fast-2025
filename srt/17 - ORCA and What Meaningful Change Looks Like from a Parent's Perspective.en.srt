1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
Um, so our next speaker is uh Dr. Abby

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
Rder. She's going to be speaking to us

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,880
about the Orca, the observer reported

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,840
communication ability measure and really

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,960
trying to explain to us what is a

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,480
minimal meaningful change. And it's very

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,000
important to try to understand that

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,760
because we take these measures and we

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,039
spend a lot of time in these assessments

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,119
and the community rallied in 300 people

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,039
filling out the original survey, another

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,279
200 people filling out another survey

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,439
over the last five, six years and then

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,559
again just recently in two weeks time we

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,079
had another 150 families more than that

16
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,079
filling out an additional survey in

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,800
order for her to collect this data with

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,280
the ultimate goal being for us to

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
understand what does a point change mean

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
for for our children. What does that

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,280
mean? Two points, three points, five

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
points. It means nothing to us. But if

23
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,520
we can understand if our kid were to

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,440
gain two points, that's a finger point.

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
That's an eye gaze. That's responding to

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,199
their name. That's responding to the

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
word yes or no. That's saying the word

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,640
yes or no with a headshake or a head

29
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,879
knot. All of those things are so

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,799
important. What do these scores actually

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,200
mean? So Aby's going to walk you through

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
some of the the the statistical methods

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,400
and the reasons why they did what they

34
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,240
did and they asked you to do those

35
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
incredible surveys. That was a lot of

36
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
work, but we're very grateful to

37
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,280
everybody that participated. So Abby,

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,280
please come and share with everybody the

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,280
results.

40
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
>> Hi

41
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Okay. Um, yeah. So, like Allison said,

42
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,320
I'm going to present on the Orca

43
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,360
measure. Um, and specifically, you know,

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,040
we've talked about the Bailey and

45
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
Vineland, and you get these nice numbers

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
from them, but what do those actually

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,240
mean? So, both in terms of what's a

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,560
meaningful change, but then also in

49
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,159
terms of what is a score of 50, what is

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,880
a score of, you know, 35? Um, brief

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,520
disclosures.

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,000
Okay, tiny bit of background. So in

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,960
order to effectively measure any new

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,440
treatment, whatever it's for, it has to

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
be fit for purpose. What does that mean?

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,599
Essentially, it's measuring what we

57
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,239
intend for it to measure and it works in

58
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,000
the population that we are using it in.

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,720
Um, so in this case, that would be

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
Angelmen. And what we find is that a lot

61
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
of the measures that were developed were

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,120
developed for a verbal population. So

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,879
specifically for communication which is

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,879
one of the most important domains um the

65
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
my team at Duke developed the observer

66
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,360
reported communication ability measure

67
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,720
directly with input from caregivers and

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,400
fast organization leadership everyone to

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,800
make sure it was like the best measure

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,680
we could make reflecting what's actually

71
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
important to caregivers. Um it measures

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,760
three domains of communication

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,080
expressive receptive and pragmatic. So

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,080
expressive is like you know conveying

75
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
your needs, thoughts, emotions in

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,239
Angelmen normally through things like

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,840
eye gaze or pointing towards something

78
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,360
things like that. Receptive

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
communication which is showing that you

80
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,319
understand something that was said to

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,840
you. Um and then uh pragmatic or social

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
communication.

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
Um just to state this again. So funding

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,680
all came from fast. So this has all come

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,920
from you all. So thank you.

86
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,239
Um so while the orc itself was developed

87
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,080
using these super rigorous you know well

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:29,360
accepted in the field methods um you

89
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,840
know when we actually run this algorithm

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,760
to get these scores from it they don't

91
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,319
mean anything on their own. And so what

92
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,480
we have to do is basically develop these

93
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,799
things called vignettes or in this case

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,840
that's what we did um to show what these

95
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,319
distinct score regions and ranges um

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
actually mean. Um, so for example, you

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,400
might have a three-year-old with

98
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,879
Angelmen who has a score 55. How does

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,560
that actually compare to others for one

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,519
thing and then also if they change

101
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,760
scores later on? Um, is that meaningful

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,360
to the individual in their family? So

103
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,480
that's my objective here. And like I

104
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,360
said before, I'm going to be showing

105
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,920
some vignettes. Um,

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,319
and I'm not going to go too in depth

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,680
into the like fancy statistics behind

108
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,480
everything just because it gets pretty

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,880
complicated. But the basis of it is that

110
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,600
with the Orca, with this really complex

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,680
algorithm, we can get kind of the most

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
likely communication behaviors at every

113
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
single individual score. And using

114
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,280
those, we can make these pretty

115
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
vignettes.

116
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,400
Um, that will not come out this pretty.

117
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
This takes quite a bit of work to get

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,759
the pictures on it. Um, but we can do

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,040
this for any score. So here I'm going to

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,160
show 35, 50, and 65. But these can be

121
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,759
used for any score, any score change on

122
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,040
the orca. And these same methods can be

123
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,560
used for for other measures as well. Um,

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,040
so like I said before, this is

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,280
presenting a hypothetical child, Alex.

126
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,120
Um, and you know, some of the things

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,040
Alex is able to do, Alex is on kind of

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,280
the higher end of the low end of the

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,040
scale. Um, so 35. Um, Alex sometimes

130
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,199
communicates that he wants an object by

131
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,479
reaching or pointing, making a sound,

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
looking at the object, and then his

133
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,600
parent or bringing the object to his

134
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,680
parent. Um, for getting attention, Alex

135
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
almost always grabs, taps, pulls on

136
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
someone, or makes a sound, and that one

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
we will follow across kind of the score

138
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,320
range. Um, and then there's some other

139
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
skills. Um, in the bottom, uh, left

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,800
you'll see some skills that Alex isn't

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
able to do. um with the Orca and then

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,560
also with these vignettes, we wanted to

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,320
focus on what uh these kids couldn't do

144
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
as opposed to what they couldn't do. Um

145
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
but just note because this is slightly

146
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,880
on the lower end, part of what is on the

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,080
Orca is things that um you know, kids on

148
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,039
the higher end of the scale would be

149
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,039
able to do. So a score of 50, this is

150
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,840
right in the middle. Um and what we see

151
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,080
here with this child, Jamie, uh is Jamie

152
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,919
is able to use AAC devices. So that's

153
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,720
kind of a big characteristic of this

154
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,680
score. Um, looking at the get attention

155
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,000
category in the, uh, far left side over

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,160
here, um, uh, Jamie is sometimes able to

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
use a symbol on her device to get

158
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
attention from her parent. Now, to be

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
reflective of the wording on the orca,

160
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,120
we also include word approximations

161
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,240
here. Realistically, at a score 50,

162
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,639
you're probably not seeing word

163
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,720
approximations, but again, trying to be

164
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,400
consistent.

165
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
So, then Riley is on the higher end of

166
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,160
the scale, and we see even more

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,479
advancements. And I think you know the

168
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,000
big landmark with Riley is that she is

169
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,199
able to use one to three word or word

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
approximations. Um and then again

171
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,800
tracking kind of that uh get attention

172
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,639
category in the far left. Um she almost

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
always uses a symbol on her device or

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
word approximation to get attention. So

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,000
going from sometimes doing that to

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,440
always doing that. Um these will be all

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
put up on the poster that I have

178
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,560
outside. So if you wanted to read more

179
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,639
thoroughly into the different skills,

180
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,319
you're welcome to.

181
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,840
So this is great. we have these

182
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,520
vignettes,

183
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,639
what do they what what can they do for

184
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,919
us? And I think that that's the

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,000
important question is if we're going to

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,000
use the Orca in clinical trials, it's

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
great. It's developed, you know, really

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,720
with so much input by caregivers, we

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
want it to be the best measure possible.

190
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,319
We want to make sure that any changes

191
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,120
were used uh we're tracking with the

192
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
Orca are meaningful. And so that's

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,680
essentially what we did. We used those

194
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,919
vignettes and we presented them right

195
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
next to each other. So we did two

196
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,840
points, four points, six points and

197
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,800
eight points. Um and we presented them

198
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
straight to caregivers and said is this

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
a meaningful improvement? You know if

200
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,560
this is a hypothetical child with

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,120
Angelman syndrome and you know it

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,800
started at a score of 55 and then went

203
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,880
up to a score of 57. Of course not

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,120
showing them that that's the change.

205
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,039
Would that be meaningful to you? Um and

206
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
what we found is that at a score change

207
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,039
of two points over half of participants

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,360
in the study said that that would be

209
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,120
meaningful to them. Um, so

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,639
what does that actually look like? And I

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,039
think what's really interesting here is

212
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,440
that a twopoint change might seem

213
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,360
relatively small. Um, especially in the

214
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
context of, you know, the score range of

215
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,000
the orca, which goes from about 20 to

216
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,599
80. Um, but when we look at the actual

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,520
changes that would happen that would

218
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,080
correspond to a twopoint change, they

219
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,240
could be quite dramatic to daily life.

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,919
Um, so some examples of this would be

221
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
you might see someone go from responding

222
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,000
when told no or stop to also sometimes

223
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,599
following onestep directions. You might

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,360
see someone start sometimes answering

225
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,879
yes or no questions. So go from never

226
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
answering yes or no questions to

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,639
sometimes doing that. And then for those

228
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,240
who are already sometimes answering yes

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,840
or no questions, you might see them also

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,159
sometimes answering open-ended question,

231
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,719
which is a huge improvement in skill.

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,919
Um, with a three-point change, of

233
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,000
course, it includes all of those

234
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,440
twopoint changes as well. But what

235
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,039
you'll also find is some some kids that

236
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,600
maybe already start pretty high

237
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,040
functioning will start using symbols.

238
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
And then a four-point change, it gets

239
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
even bigger where you see again kids who

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
are relatively high functioning start to

241
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,640
use uh one to three word or word

242
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
approximations. This is not to say that

243
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,640
this is very very common at this level.

244
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,120
this is really only happening in a few

245
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,760
kids where you start to see um you know

246
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,680
it become much more consistent is around

247
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,959
an eight point change. Um and there's

248
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,240
actually a plot you can see where it

249
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,160
just levels out at eight. Um but I think

250
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,200
you know the the major takeaway here is

251
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,600
that when we actually talk to caregivers

252
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,320
about what's meaningful in their lives a

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,120
relatively small score change of two

254
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,040
potentially even smaller is actually

255
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,640
very meaningful. Um, and this is, I

256
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,640
think, what a lot of people predicted,

257
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,720
what a lot of you probably already knew.

258
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,360
Um, but it's great to have, you know, in

259
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,600
an actual study that we will publish and

260
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,880
hopefully tell the FDA that, you know,

261
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,000
this is something that's meaningful to

262
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,600
this population. Um, future directions,

263
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,880
you know, we're hoping to continue the

264
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,040
study about meaningful score

265
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,959
differences. So, like, you know, this is

266
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,839
very preliminary data. We will continue

267
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,000
onward with everything. Um, also, we're

268
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,720
working on creating kind of regions. So

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
low intermediate and high ability um

270
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
communication ability and then also the

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
orc itself is being translated into

272
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,920
other neurodedevelopmental conditions.

273
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,120
Um so hopefully we can use these same

274
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,240
methods to develop venance for them too.

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,920
Big thank you to everyone on my team. Um

276
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,839
yeah, especially Bryce Ree who's sitting

277
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,440
right here and Nicole Lucas. Um and then

278
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,760
also of course Allison and Jennifer for

279
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
all they've done and thank you to all of

280
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,880
you all. This is all supported by

281
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
caregivers. So thank you.

282
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,920
That's incredible work and it's been

283
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,040
years of effort and thank you for

284
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,560
putting that all together for our

285
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
community because this has been a huge

286
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,399
effort by our community. Um, what I want

287
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
everyone to acknowledge is when we look

288
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,920
at these end points in clinical trials,

289
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
when we're trying to understand and

290
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,880
assess expressive or receptive language,

291
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,360
which we all want desperately, things

292
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,279
like the Bailey don't capture anything

293
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,839
but words, word approximations, or

294
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,640
babble. They don't capture the AAC use

295
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,040
that might change well before or instead

296
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,360
of words. it doesn't really capture

297
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,160
signs and symbols, gestures and eye

298
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,399
gaze, all of those things in which are

299
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,640
really meaningful as our kids gain

300
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,880
skills and communication abilities. And

301
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,680
so for us to be able to see a measure

302
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,959
that deeply captures that that real

303
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,079
distinguished change at a granular level

304
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,720
to truly be able to place my child in a

305
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,600
category so I can see change in all of

306
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,000
these areas that I dream about for her

307
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,760
is huge. And that is all because of the

308
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,079
work of you guys. This was one of the

309
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,440
only measures for Angelmen syndrome to

310
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,760
date that is being used in clinical

311
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,600
trials that we started from scratch from

312
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,320
nothing. And that was because of the

313
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,320
input and the collaboration and the real

314
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
commitment by caregivers. So, thank you

315
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,079
to Bryce and Nicole and Abby for their

316
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,000
their commitment to this project. And

317
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,000
thank you to the FDA for recommending we

318
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,519
do this project. Um, but most

319
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
importantly, thank you to the caregivers

320
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,440
because we couldn't have done it without

321
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,440
all of you.
