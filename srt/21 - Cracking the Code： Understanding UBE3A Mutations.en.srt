1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,680
Okay, next we have Nikki Armstrong who's

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,040
fast genetic um genetic counselor who's

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,280
going to be talking to us about cracking

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,280
the code, understanding UB3 mutations.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,100
[Applause]

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
Okay, so we've talked already a lot

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,880
today about the UB3A gene making the

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,720
UB3A protein, but there's one key piece

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
that I wanted to cover um when we're

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,679
thinking about mutations, and that's how

11
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,440
the gene codes for the protein. So in

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,680
the picture here, you can see that the

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,239
gene has is made up of chemicals that we

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,559
call nucleotides. So those are the ACTs

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,960
and G's shown there. And the body reads

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,040
those nucleotides three at a time. And

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,360
for every three of those nucleotides, it

18
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,360
puts on one piece of a protein. So three

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,760
chemicals codes for one amino acid or

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,480
one piece of the protein. The cells read

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,239
the gene, make the string of amino acids

22
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,160
from the code of the gene, and that

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
string of amino acids goes through

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,960
complex folding and processing to make

25
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,519
the functional UB3A protein. And that's

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,479
shown there as the green blob.

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,960
So when we have a mutation in the UB3A

28
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,640
gene, there's a change a within the code

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,200
within those chemicals that make up the

30
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
gene that makes the the resulting

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,560
protein either absent or non-functional

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,200
or less functional. And that change

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,360
could be um just one nucleotide that's

34
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
affected. It could be 50 or a couple of

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
hundred nucleotides affected. But for it

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,400
to be mutation as it has to be

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,920
completely within the UB3A gene. And

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
it's really important to understand that

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,200
there are hundreds or maybe even

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,600
thousands of different mutations within

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
the UB3A gene and they can all affect

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,360
the protein differently.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439
So we've already talked a lot today

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,360
about what the UB3A protein actually

45
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
does. One key role of course is that

46
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
flagging that we talked about. So adding

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,119
ubiquitin to other proteins to help the

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
the cells know it's time to break them

49
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,479
down. In order to do the jobs that the

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,320
UB3A protein is supposed to do, it has a

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
number of different domains or sections

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,000
of the protein that interact with the

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
other proteins. So, we saw some of that

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,840
in earlier talks today. And you can see

55
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,039
some of the three-dimensional structure

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,800
that's shown there that looks like the

57
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,319
curly cues. Those are some of the

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
different portions that interact with

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,640
other proteins. Those are all really

60
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,000
important. If we have disruptions in the

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,120
way that some of those structures are

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,640
made, they're not able to bond to or to

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,560
associate with the other proteins that

64
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,520
they need to. And there are parts of the

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,680
UB33A protein that are completely

66
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
necessary for the function. One key role

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,920
there, if you can see that teeny tiny

68
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,760
little red star, that spot at 820,

69
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,640
that's the spot where ubiquin actually

70
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,879
bonds or attaches. So if that spot has a

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,040
problem with it, the UB3A isn't going to

72
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
be able to do any of its adding the tags

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
onto things.

74
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,000
So we know that mutation as is really

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,840
variable. It can affect each person

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
living with mutation as differently,

77
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
different degree of symptoms and

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,160
severities and a lot of that has to do

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
with the fact that each mutation can

80
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,680
affect the protein differently. So we

81
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,920
set out to better characterize the

82
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,159
mutations. We started looking within the

83
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,840
global angelman syndrome registry and we

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,159
had 61 participants there with the

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,760
mutation genotype. But then we wanted to

86
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,360
broaden that. And so what we did was

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,680
actually look in a number of other data

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,760
sets. And we ended up with a total of

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,920
279 different UB3A mutations that we

90
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,000
classified and characterized based on

91
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,920
what they do to the gene itself and then

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
what they do to the protein. And for

93
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
more details about this, I'm happy to go

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
through it. It's all on my poster in the

95
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,360
poster session.

96
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,360
So

97
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
in trying to understand the variability

98
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,239
in the mutation as there's sort of two

99
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,159
key pieces. one is where in the protein

100
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,159
are the mutations. So what we're seeing

101
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,000
here on the bottom is the protein again

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,920
with the different domains and then what

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
we're seeing on the top is a mapping of

104
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,799
the mutation at the amino acid that

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,400
occurred at the key pieces here are one

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
mutations are throughout the entire

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,159
protein. Right? You can see little blue

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,319
lines throughout the entire protein. But

109
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,959
then if you look towards the end of the

110
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,120
protein, so around the 800s there where

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,360
that key spot is where ubiquitin bl

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,680
binds you, you can see more blue there

113
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,519
and higher blue lines. That means there

114
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,120
are more mutations affecting that part

115
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
of the protein. That part of the protein

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,199
is um very important. And so that's what

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
we see there.

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
The second piece that causes variability

119
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,400
in mutation as is that each mutation can

120
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,280
affect the protein differently. We have

121
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,680
some mutations that result in no UB3A

122
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,080
protein at all. Some mutations that

123
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,840
result in a UB3A protein that's just

124
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,080
missing an important piece like missing

125
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
the ubiquitin, please. And then we have

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,040
some mutations that will result in a

127
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,120
UB3A protein that is has a completely

128
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,720
abnormal structure and so it's sort of

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,960
hard to predict what it can do and what

130
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
it can't do. And you can you can

131
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,120
understand that these different kinds of

132
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,960
mutations and different UV3A proteins

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,199
might interact differently, right? and

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,960
cause maybe a different kind of symptoms

135
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
and also we might need to think about

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,720
therapies differently depending on the

137
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,199
effect of the protein.

138
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,600
So bottom line is mutations are really

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,000
complicated. We can classify them based

140
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,520
on how they affect the gene. We can but

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,759
more importantly really is understanding

142
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,840
how they affect the protein and what we

143
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,800
really need to do are collect and map

144
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
and model as many mutations as possible.

145
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
So, especially if you have a loved one

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,560
living with mutation as please join the

147
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,280
global angelman syndrome registry and

148
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
update your uh your account with your

149
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
registry or with your genetic test

150
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
report so that we can make sure we've

151
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,110
got our broad-based mutations. Thank

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,459
you.

153
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,459
[Applause]

154
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,280
That's so important and it's critical as

155
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,280
we think about inclusion criteria into

156
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,280
clinical trials and I want everyone to

157
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,720
just accost Nikki throughout the rest of

158
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
the weekend if you have a child with a

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,320
mutation so she can talk to you and

160
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,160
really gain the knowledge of your child

161
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,000
and you can share um that genetic

162
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
information so she can help navigate

163
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,199
this. So I think it's really really

164
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,400
important that we best understand

165
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,400
mutations in Angel syndrome.
