1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,520
Um, so our next talk is by Dr. Adriana

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,160
Gomez. Understanding GI challenges in

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,519
Angelmen Syndrome. What families can

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,519
learn from the natural history study.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,760
>> Hello. Oh,

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,359
okay. So, um, I'm going to present a

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,599
little bit of, uh, our work from the

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,760
natural history study. So, first I'd

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,360
like to thank all the families for

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,920
participating and if you're not

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,480
participating, please we have our people

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,520
outside and we'll be happy to have you.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,559
I also like to thank my mentor Dr. Bird

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,800
who started a natural history study uh

15
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,280
with um Terry Joe uh long ago in 2004

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,039
and uh since then we've been collecting

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:58,879
this data with now um with the help with

18
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,640
Wenhan and Anjelie a phenomenal team. uh

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,800
working in this effort and I'd like to

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
thank Bat Shiva as well for putting this

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,560
work together and allowing me to be here

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:11,920
presenting this work for you.

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,320
So this is a little bit of our uh study.

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,000
So we have um nine sites right now uh in

25
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,320
the US and in Canada and for a while we

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,200
were funded by the NIH for another

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,840
period for uh we were funded by the FDA

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,159
and now currently uh we have the help of

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,040
Ebel um and the enrollment is easy so

30
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,360
you can just reach out to all of us and

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,200
um and we'll collect the data anyway. So

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,280
going forwards for the main important

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,640
thing um we you know the symptoms of uh

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,439
GI um tract and the most important thing

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,439
is how it goes throughout the life and

36
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,720
how important it is an interaction of

37
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,040
the GI symptoms and uh the impact that

38
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,240
it has in the in the health overall

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,880
health of our uh children. uh the GI

40
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,840
symptoms start early in life as you can

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,120
see and the feeding problems are really

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,280
important. You see that about 70% of

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,760
children with deletion will present with

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,959
feeding difficulties early in life and

45
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160
this can be so severe that lead to uh

46
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,480
failure gaining weight. uh you it's it

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,440
is more important in a deletion subgroup

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,480
but the m mutations uh uh the kids with

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,319
mutation also present a very important

50
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,800
um difficulties gning weight

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,440
and the GI symptoms persist throughout

52
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,440
the life you see that later in life

53
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,640
you're going to have the reflux it can

54
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,160
start earlier as well but also goes

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,480
throughout the life with as uh much as

56
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,560
40% of our patients with delions present

57
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,120
and some uh degree of reflux. And uh you

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
see it's a little bit less for the other

59
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,760
uh subtypes, but it's still very

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,760
important about a third of our patients.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,879
Um and you see that the most common um

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,680
treatments that we do are proton pump

63
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,159
inhibitors and the H2 receptor

64
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,959
antagonist and ant acids to help with

65
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,879
the symptoms.

66
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,360
Uh in terms of constipation,

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,120
constipation is the biggest deal. I must

68
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,360
say we have about 70% of our patients uh

69
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,799
complaining of constipation and I'm sure

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,680
you guys know that well um we created a

71
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,040
way to score the constipation in our fam

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,720
in our um group and we are taking in

73
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,120
consideration the frequence of um bowel

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,480
movements per week and the consistence

75
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,400
of the stools and the uh number of

76
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,000
medications that we need to take. And

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,640
then we classify it in mild uh moderate

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,480
and severe. And you see that most of our

79
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,120
children will present with moderate

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,920
constipation. Uh and the number of

81
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,040
medication takens is also uh

82
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,480
considerable. So about 50% of our

83
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,080
patients are taking some medication for

84
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,200
um for constipation and they can vary in

85
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,560
stimulants or laxatives or some type of

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,759
dietary supplements and those are fibers

87
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,240
or um magnesium but one important thing

88
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,040
that I want mention here is that you see

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,320
them about 50 70% or 80% of our patients

90
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,600
will have constipation but we are seeing

91
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,800
that only 50% about 50% of our patients

92
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,120
are treating this. So is there a gap? Is

93
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,840
there a barrier? Why aren't we treating

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,840
that well enough?

95
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,080
So why am I talking about GI 2 and why

96
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,880
did I say it's all so important? There

97
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,600
is a correlation between the GI symptoms

98
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,759
and seizures. Uh my idea is to

99
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
eventually see what's a correlation with

100
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,400
the GI symptoms with behavior and sleep

101
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,840
too. Eventually we'll get there with

102
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,160
some help with analyzing all this data.

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,880
But what we have so far is clear that

104
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,960
there is a correlation. I just want to

105
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,560
remind you that correlation is not

106
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,000
causation. Right? So we have more

107
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,600
symptoms of uh GI symptoms reported.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,440
There is uh more prevalence too of

109
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,840
seizures and this is uh at this level.

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,560
So if someone is complaining of the GI

111
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,520
symptoms, you're going to see as high as

112
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,840
a prevalence of 53 to to 100% of the

113
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,520
patients with seizures. And when there

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,280
are nine symptoms of um GI and these are

115
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,880
all of those reflux, gagging, drooling,

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,479
uh you're going to see the prevalence of

117
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,960
seizures are way lower.

118
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,160
And then we also check all the uh

119
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,400
prevalence of seizures. So here we can

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,560
see that most of our patients are well

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,440
controlled about 90% of them uh did not

122
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,759
present any severe seizures in the last

123
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,479
four weeks and those are the medications

124
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,479
that they are doing.

125
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,759
Thank you.

126
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:20,614
>> [applause]

127
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,080
>> See, it doesn't take 30 minutes to get

128
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,080
great data.
