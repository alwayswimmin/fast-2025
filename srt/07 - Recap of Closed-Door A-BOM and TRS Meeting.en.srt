1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
So with that, I will welcome our next

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,800
speaker

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,960
who is myself and Jennifer Panagulus who

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,480
is hopefully sitting somewhere near Oh,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,839
she's right there. Um, so Jennifer

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,760
Panagulius is um an unbelievable force.

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,359
Most of you know her. I'm gonna let her

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,920
introduce herself. But one thing I would

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,519
like to say is that

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,640
so much of what I just showed you at AS2

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,679
Bio and Ebon is because of her and she

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,440
doesn't like to be seen or heard. She

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
likes to stay in the background, but she

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
deserves more credit than any of you

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,920
will ever know. So, Jennifer, please

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,920
come up.

17
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:43,285
[applause]

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,760
So we will go to the next presentation.

19
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,520
We are going to recap what we heard

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
yesterday at the Angelman Syndrome

21
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
Bioarker and Alchemist Consortium and

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,280
the translational research symposium. We

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
want to recap that for you because it's

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,199
a closed door session in which parents

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,119
aren't there. And the reason for that is

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,600
to keep it intimate, collaborative, and

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,439
very research focused and driven in a

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,159
way in which we don't want people to

29
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,240
have to change the tone or the tenor of

30
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
the way they're speaking about research

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,799
from to make sure the whole audience

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,119
understands it. It's fast. It's a

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,000
lightning speed. It was 35 talks in nine

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,640
hours, but we got there and we got

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,640
through it and we learned so very much.

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,720
So basically 20 talks for ABOM

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
and 10 talks for the translational

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,479
research symposium

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,079
and we're going to summarize those for

40
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,759
you. So, as most of you know, I've

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,560
already introduced myself. I have many

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,920
roles here, but the most important role

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,479
that I play, particularly for the Avon,

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,720
is that I'm the mother to Quincy. And I

45
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,360
have to think about and talk about what

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,119
is meaningful and measurable to her

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,799
because that is patient focused drug

48
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,640
development. And I'm going to pass it

49
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,280
off to Jennifer to give you the scoop of

50
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
everything that we learned yesterday.

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,159
>> Do you want me to just jump to the

52
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,600
summary slide, do you think? No,

53
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,600
>> introduce yourself. Okay.

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,959
I don't know where that went.

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,440
Ah, here we go. Hi, thank you um for

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,640
having me here today. It's always a

57
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
pleasure to be here and it's really

58
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
amazing every year to see how many

59
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,599
people attend this meeting and take the

60
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
time out of your busy lives to come and

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,680
learn. So, thank you so much. Um I'm

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,599
Jennifer Panigulas. and the head of

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
regulatory and policy at FAST,

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,319
co-director of the Abomb with Allison.

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,840
Um, and I also have a role at AS2 Bio

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,319
and and some of the portfolio companies

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,280
like Maverick's Bio. Um, but I'm also an

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,080
advocate and I absolutely love um

69
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,760
engaging with the community in PFDD and

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
advocacy activities. And I want to thank

71
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
Ryan and Amanda in particular for an

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
amazing year this year. I think it was a

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,239
landmark year in terms of our raising

74
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
vis visibility for Angelman syndrome in

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,200
Washington and with the FDA in

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,280
particular and that was really um you

77
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
know driven by your stories and your

78
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,319
participation in those efforts and it

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,080
really goes a long way with the

80
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,480
regulators to help their understanding.

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,360
So thank you. Um, I'm going to tell you

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
a little bit about the ABOM, um, which

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
Allison alluded to in her last

84
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,360
presentation, but essentially we have a

85
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
goal of advancing or creating

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,720
identifying drug development tools that

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
will advance the regulatory science for

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
Angelman syndrome. And that's really

89
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
just a fancy way of saying we want to

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,640
make sure that there's appropriate tools

91
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,480
to measure changes if we're running

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,400
clinical trials of individuals um, with

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,959
Angelman syndrome to make sure that the

94
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,040
changes are in fact meaningful. And in

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,480
advancing the regulatory science, we're

96
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,879
just trying to make it easy for the

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,480
regulators to understand these tools so

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,400
that they can make decisions about

99
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,040
whether or not to approve drugs for AS.

100
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,239
The purpose is really to bring together

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,519
uh a consortium of individuals including

102
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,480
um academics, so researchers, doctors,

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,319
industry, and advocates to make sure

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,560
we're really all on the same page about

105
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,640
what we're measuring and how we measure

106
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
it. And you would think that this is an

107
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
easy thing to do, but it's not always

108
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,079
that easy. People are doing this in

109
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,440
addition to their full-time jobs at at

110
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,680
uh hospitals or at companies or at fast

111
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,160
and ASF. And it's really important

112
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,160
because having that consensus is an

113
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
important way to drive things forward

114
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
with with the FDA, with the European

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,320
Medicine's Agency and other regulators

116
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,160
around the world because when we're on

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,360
the same page, it gives them confidence

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,600
that we're moving in the right

119
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,280
direction. And part of that is engaging

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,360
with them, which we did yesterday and we

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,080
do periodically to make sure that they

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,240
feel aligned with where we're going with

123
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,080
the identification of outcome measures

124
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,720
and biomarkers to be used in clinical

125
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,199
trials of Angelman syndrome. Um, a

126
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,120
really important part of the ABOM is in

127
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,520
identifying what's out there. If we see

128
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,360
gaps, we have to think about should we

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,199
fill them? Should we work as the ABOM to

130
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,680
fill these gaps? And an example of a gap

131
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,080
we filled was on a measure to assess

132
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,520
communication in individuals with AS.

133
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,960
And that's called the ORCA or the

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,960
observer reported communication

135
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,880
abilities measure which I think some of

136
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,360
you have heard of and participated in

137
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,520
surveys to develop. Um and that really

138
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,320
really was born out of a conversation

139
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,840
with FDA several years ago where they

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,440
felt maybe we didn't have the best

141
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
battery of assessments to look at

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,639
communication abilities in someone who

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,320
is non-verbal. Uh and so we we started

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,600
to work on that as the ABOM together

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,600
with Duke University. And you'll hear

146
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,520
more about that measure later today. But

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
that's an example of where we saw a gap

148
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,199
and filled it. And really making sure

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
that we have rigorous tools that they're

150
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
high quality and we feel like they're

151
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,120
fit for purpose to use in trials and

152
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,520
sharing. This is actually the most

153
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,000
important thing that the ABOM does is

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,960
making sure information isn't held back

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,120
or siloed by one group because it

156
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,039
doesn't help the field at large and the

157
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,960
community at large just to have

158
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,199
information here and have nobody else

159
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,840
know about it. So if you're part of this

160
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,759
forum, you're expected to share and we

161
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
want to uh hold everybody to that high

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,560
standard to really push the community

163
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,080
forward as a whole.

164
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
The mission is to really make sure we

165
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,080
have a framework for clinical trial

166
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,639
design. And that means having outcome

167
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,600
measures that that look at symptoms that

168
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,360
are meaningful and important to measure

169
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,039
in individuals with Angelin syndrome. So

170
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
that if we use a treatment, we're seeing

171
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,160
that it has positive benefits in those

172
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,759
measures. We also look to identify

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
biomarkers and I'm going to talk about

174
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,680
that more in my next presentation. and

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
just to make sure we have consensus

176
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,479
about that to push field forward the

177
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
field of research in the hopes that

178
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
we're going to benefit all individuals.

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,000
So we're not thinking about one age

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,720
group or one genotype. We're trying to

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
think holistically across the whole um

182
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,440
spectrum of individuals that live with

183
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,919
Angelman syndrome.

184
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,919
Allison showed you this and um what I

185
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
just want to mention here is that the

186
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,240
ABOM is part of a really bigger

187
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,720
framework that FAST has uh undertaken

188
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
over the years to make sure that we're

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
ready to have therapies approved for

190
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Angelmen syndrome and it starts with

191
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,199
research. You've heard about uh

192
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
organoids and cell lines and animal

193
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
models and that's all part of it. But

194
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,800
the Abbomb's a really important link in

195
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,360
that chain because once you have

196
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
promising candidates or promising drugs

197
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
that you think might work in improving

198
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,800
the symptoms of Angelman syndrome, you

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,280
have to have a framework to measure

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,759
that. And so making sure that clinical

201
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,319
trial readiness is part of the landscape

202
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,919
is a really critical piece because if if

203
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,319
companies in particular, if industry

204
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,160
thinks there's not a good way to measure

205
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,280
change in Angelman syndrome, it makes it

206
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
hard and then they don't want to

207
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,440
necessarily spend the money to run

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,840
trials there. So equally important with

209
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,520
animal models and cell lines is making

210
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,039
sure we have ways to measure change.

211
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,639
Allison took you through this. So I'm

212
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,000
going to jump through our history and

213
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,160
and vision. Um and you know about the

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
symptoms, but what I want to comment on

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,960
here is something the Abomb thinks about

216
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,599
deeply is the impact of the symptoms of

217
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,479
your children on you as the parent. And

218
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,160
that comes into our our focus about how

219
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,240
we measure change and what's the meaning

220
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,199
of that change because sometimes when we

221
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,800
look at change uh in the individual, it

222
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
also has a positive impact on the

223
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
family. And a great example is sleep,

224
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,960
right? That came up yesterday and we had

225
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,360
a long talk about that. But if your

226
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,120
child's sleep improves, it's probably

227
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,479
also true that your sleep improves if

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,320
you're not up at night taking care of

229
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,680
your child and attending to their needs

230
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,399
or having to sleep with them every

231
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
night. So we think about the impact and

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,159
factor that into what we're looking at

233
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
at times.

234
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,600
We do that by collecting patient

235
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
experience data. And this has been

236
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,760
something that the ABOM has been focused

237
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,920
on since its inception. And really it

238
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
started with work to outline the disease

239
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,000
through a concept model which is really

240
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,560
just a map of all the symptoms and a

241
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,760
publication in 2020 that mapped that and

242
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,920
then survey work. So we do surveys even

243
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,680
as simple as a Facebook survey or or the

244
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
more robust surveys like the one that

245
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,959
was before the patient focused drug

246
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
development meeting that happened in

247
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,760
April to get feedback from you on your

248
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,839
lived experience. And this is really

249
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
important because if we're not designing

250
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
trials in a way that factors in your

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,240
lived experience, we might be measuring

252
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,040
the wrong things or measuring things

253
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,800
that you don't think are important.

254
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,120
Um Allison has talked about the natural

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,160
history study. Um but what I think is a

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,760
a great um uh feature of the Abomb's

257
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
work is that we've actually financially

258
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
supported this study. So um it goes back

259
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,120
to 2006

260
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,519
uh through the work of WHON the team at

261
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Boston Children's Raidies um and this

262
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
has been a really important data

263
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,320
collection vehicle for many many years.

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,560
So it was first funded by the NIH and

265
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,399
then for five years by FDA and then the

266
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,720
last three years by some of the members

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,240
of the ABOM and we see the value in

268
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,160
keeping this going. So your

269
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,640
contributions there are critically

270
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
important and we thank you for that.

271
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,800
That's also given rise to um other

272
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,680
natural history studies in the UK,

273
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,240
Belgium, uh Latam and Spain supported by

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,560
other entities and so it helps us

275
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,160
globally to really continue to collect

276
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
this data and inform the research

277
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
landscape.

278
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,920
Uh this is what Allison just showed you

279
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,240
which is essentially that that natural

280
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,760
history data has a strong application.

281
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,920
And what I want to highlight here is

282
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,880
that it's so informative with global

283
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,880
regulators because they are really of

284
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,560
the mindset that you have to show me the

285
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
proof, right? It's not just enough to

286
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,279
tell me like in my clinical experience

287
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,720
as a physician, which I'm not, but in

288
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,640
the case of a physician talking to the

289
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,880
agency, in my clinical experience, I I

290
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,120
ran a trial and I think that my patient

291
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,880
on this drug is doing better because I

292
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,920
know that generally my patients don't do

293
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,680
this. And what FDA and the European

294
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Medicine's Agency really want to see is

295
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,079
the proof, right? They want to see the

296
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,839
proof that you've actually made a change

297
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,880
and you can see that it's different than

298
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,120
an untreated individual. Um, and so data

299
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,279
really underly this and make it more

300
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,040
powerful when you're trying to show them

301
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,360
that we believe that a drug is having a

302
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,040
promising effect because it's vastly

303
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,880
different than what we know and is

304
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,839
documented. So when you put that in

305
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,440
front of them, it's very powerful.

306
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,440
I'll skip ahead on this.

307
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,320
I'm going to go um to the patient

308
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,200
focused drug development meeting. Um

309
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,519
this meeting in in April was really so

310
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,760
pivotal in the understanding and it

311
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,920
resulted in a voice of the patient

312
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,320
report which was published yesterday on

313
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,079
FDA's website. So you can access it or

314
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,279
it's also available on the fast and ASF

315
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,279
website and it details important aspects

316
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,680
of the lived experience in terms of

317
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,920
symptoms that you feel as a community

318
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,079
are very important how they impact you

319
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,519
and how they impact your loved one and

320
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,839
what you want to see as treatment

321
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,959
priorities. And this report gets

322
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,760
utilized by FDA and even other agencies

323
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:10,000
uh to really help them understand

324
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,320
what the meaning of these symptoms and

325
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,920
the meaning of changes are to you and

326
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
they need to factor that into their

327
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,360
regulatory decision making. So it's

328
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,200
really key in in their regulatory review

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
of applications that they'll get in the

330
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,440
future and it also as I said informs the

331
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,600
work that we do at ABOM because we want

332
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,680
to make sure we we focus more on the

333
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
measures that you care most about.

334
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,320
So with that, yesterday's meeting um was

335
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,839
a great meeting. It was one of the best

336
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,959
meetings I think we've ever had as the

337
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,959
ABOM. Um and what we started with was a

338
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,320
conversation really around the PFDD

339
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,480
meeting. It's not noted here on my

340
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,720
slide, but Ryan Fischer gave an overview

341
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,480
of the work that was done um in the

342
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,040
premeating survey and then in the

343
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,360
meeting itself that led to the voice of

344
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,399
the patient report highlighting some of

345
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,800
the the uh the feedback and testimonies

346
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,760
that were given and the impact of that.

347
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,120
Um, and it was really a great review and

348
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
I want to thank everybody that

349
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,959
participated in the surveys and the

350
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,200
meeting itself because we did have a

351
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,839
debrief with FDA after that meeting and

352
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,839
they said it was so impactful that at

353
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,680
times some of your feedback was actually

354
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,720
hard to hear because they didn't even

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,519
understand how absolutely devastating

356
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,519
the condition can be on families and it

357
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,920
really makes them feel more motivated

358
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,839
but also they understand more. they

359
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
learn more about the impact of symptoms

360
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,920
on your day-to-day life. And so that was

361
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
really good feedback and we had amazing

362
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,000
attendance. Almost 50 people from the

363
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,480
FDA were at the PFDD meeting or

364
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,320
virtually part of it. Um and it's really

365
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
something that they want to build on and

366
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,320
so they asked the Abbomb to follow up on

367
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,760
a few things coming out of that meeting.

368
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,000
One of those things was better

369
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,240
understanding your attitudes as a

370
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,880
community towards the risks and benefits

371
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,440
of gene therapies for Angelman syndrome.

372
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,519
So what we did coming out of the PFDD

373
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,000
meeting was we had some focus groups

374
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,399
where we got feedback from individuals

375
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
in the community about their attitudes

376
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,959
towards how you would think about the

377
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
benefits and risks of gene therapies.

378
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,560
What are you worried about? What do you

379
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,480
think about the safety? Um what do you

380
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,079
think about the efficacy? Importantly,

381
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,240
what do you need to know to help make

382
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,720
decisions about considering

383
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,279
participation in a clinical trial of a

384
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,000
gene therapy? um how do you need

385
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,199
information presented to you and really

386
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,560
are you willing to do it? Are you

387
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,160
willing to consider this for your child?

388
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,079
What's your willingness or what are what

389
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,600
are your reservations? And the agency

390
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,839
really wants to know that better because

391
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,160
they've said to us that especially in a

392
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,079
rare disease they understand the way

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,839
that it's often approached is you're

394
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,839
willing to do anything. At the outset

395
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,920
you think I am willing to do whatever it

396
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
takes to get a treatment for my child.

397
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,800
But sometimes there comes a point where

398
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,279
you're presented with information and

399
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,760
you feel, you know, maybe this is a step

400
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,839
too far or maybe I don't understand

401
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,519
enough about this. And that's what the

402
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,040
agency really wants us to do so we can

403
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,399
think about in taking these trials

404
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
forward. What's the best way to

405
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
communicate with you and present

406
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,639
educational materials or have the doctor

407
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,480
have conversations with you that really

408
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
educate you? And the only way we can

409
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,839
know what you think about it is for you

410
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,760
to tell us. And so we presented on that

411
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,920
yesterday, which was really an an

412
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,680
interesting conversation.

413
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,760
I didn't get to update my slide, but we

414
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,160
were supposed to um hear from the FDA on

415
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,240
this as well, and unfortunately they

416
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,160
canled due to the shutdown. So, in

417
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,079
addition to disrupting all your flights,

418
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,160
the shutdown was keeping FDA from coming

419
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,839
to our meeting.

420
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,560
We also talked about the Orca and what

421
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,399
Orca scores mean. Um, and really what we

422
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,639
did there was we had a very powerful

423
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,519
panel where we heard from five moms

424
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,680
about how they uh how how their child

425
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,079
communicates and they took part in a

426
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,519
survey about the orca and really gave

427
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,519
feedback to the team about what changes

428
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,639
in the ORCA mean like what do they think

429
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,800
a score um let's say of 50 you know when

430
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,000
you're developing these measures you

431
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,440
have to understand how they work but

432
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
then also how do you score them and what

433
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,720
does that score really mean? So, they

434
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,240
reflected on what a score meant to them

435
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,839
based on their child's abilities and

436
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,240
what they thought a meaningful change

437
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,320
would be. And that really informs how we

438
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
think about changes on the scale. Do you

439
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,320
need to move two points? Do you need to

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,639
move four points? And and that feedback

441
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,920
is very powerful in informing how we

442
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
interpret those scores and how

443
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,240
regulators interpret those scores. And

444
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,839
then we really built off that lived

445
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
experience of families from the patient

446
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,920
focused drug development meeting in a in

447
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,920
a number of sessions. One focused on

448
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,320
challenging behaviors and this was an

449
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,720
area followup followup that FDA wanted

450
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,639
us to undertake. They heard you talk a

451
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,600
lot about anxiety in that meeting and in

452
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,440
the survey and and what we really want

453
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,279
to do is sort of tease apart what is

454
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,600
anxiety and angelman syndrome. Is it

455
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,839
really challenging behaviors? And so

456
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,279
they asked us to dive deeper into that.

457
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,519
We actually did have someone from the

458
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,120
FDA who still participated in the

459
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,800
meeting come and talk to us about that

460
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,720
and how we might consider that and

461
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,040
measure that. But what we did was

462
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,360
reflect on the learnings from the PFDD

463
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,680
meeting. And if any of you participated

464
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,199
in the premeating survey, we asked you

465
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,520
to rank your top five treatment

466
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,919
priorities, but then to explain to us in

467
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,559
writing what you thought would be a

468
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,839
meaningful change in a symptom. And so

469
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,720
if you did that, I want to thank you

470
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,240
because we got almost 1,700 line items

471
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
on a spreadsheet and we actually went

472
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
through all of those responses and

473
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,400
presented it back to the Abomb to sort

474
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,160
of think about what's really involved in

475
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,520
the concept of anxiety and challenging

476
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,000
behaviors. What does that really mean?

477
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,559
Is it aggression? Is it hitting? Is it

478
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,960
impulsivity? And really like teasing

479
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,960
that apart to understand it more so we

480
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,120
can better design measures and trials to

481
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
capture that. And importantly to hear

482
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,799
what you think is important. And we

483
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,960
clearly heard that very small changes in

484
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,799
behavior could make a big difference in

485
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
your day-to-day.

486
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,520
We did the same for sleep and cognitive

487
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,919
domains. Uh and really what we did was

488
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,200
hear from uh teams at Rush and Boston

489
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,520
Children's about what they've learned

490
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
about aspects of sleep and cognition

491
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,960
that are important to you, how we

492
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,799
measure those, what's the best way to

493
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
consider measure those in trials. And

494
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,720
again reflecting that experience that

495
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,799
you gave through your responses in the

496
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,440
survey about what matters to you in

497
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,200
sleep, sleeping more, waking up less at

498
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
night, uh maybe using less sleep

499
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,799
medications. All of that we're factoring

500
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
into our considerations of how we

501
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,120
measure that in clinical trials. And I

502
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,120
think that I will hand it off to

503
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,120
Allison.

504
00:18:28,927 --> 00:18:30,947
>> [applause]

505
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,160
>> Thank you Jennifer that was perfect. Um

506
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,720
and so overall I think that um you can

507
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,799
see her conclusions about the regulatory

508
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,520
engagement that we have, the industry

509
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,520
and advocacy engagement that we have and

510
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,240
we keep reminding everyone why we're

511
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,160
here and we are here for these children

512
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
and that is the only reason and we need

513
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,000
to ensure that patient focused drug

514
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,600
development is at the core of everything

515
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
that we do and is at the core of

516
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,600
everyone in this room. um because that's

517
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,840
the only way we can transform the lives

518
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,480
of those that we love deeply living with

519
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,000
Angelman syndrome. Um we followed that

520
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,919
with the translational research

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,320
symposium which is where our scientists

522
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,559
can get deep deep deep into the science

523
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,160
and not have to you know keep it in lay

524
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,520
terms for all of the rest of us to

525
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,679
understand. Um, and so again, we um had

526
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,679
those 20 talks at AOM and then we had

527
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,160
these 10 lightning abstracts that I'm

528
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,840
really excited for you guys to see

529
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,960
something similar today, but we're doing

530
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,360
it in lay terms. Um, and those abstracts

531
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,160
were incredibly helpful and I actually

532
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,039
loved the format. these and these folks

533
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,960
spoke so fast and so quickly and got to

534
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
the point and didn't, you know, really

535
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
have to explain the background because

536
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,440
everyone in the room knew the background

537
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,919
and could really just get to the

538
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,080
conclusions which were the core and the

539
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,600
purpose. And so really we started the

540
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,760
translational research symposium to

541
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,240
create an environment where cutting edge

542
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,880
research can be shared with colleagues

543
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,559
in the scientific field and industry and

544
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,720
the clinicians who are going to see this

545
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,600
coming forward on the medical side for

546
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,280
our for our kids hopefully soon. Um and

547
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,520
we like to foster collaboration and

548
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,679
shared knowledge and problem solve

549
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,039
understand scientific discovery in a way

550
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,200
in which we can help improve the

551
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,120
outcomes of other people's labs by

552
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,720
learnings in a different lab. And if we

553
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,960
don't have an environment to collaborate

554
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,640
and do that, ultimately everyone's going

555
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
to work in a silo, which is not great

556
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,360
for any of our children. And so we

557
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,200
really are able to consider novel ideas,

558
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,200
bring the field closer to transformative

559
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,960
therapeutic development and be okay if

560
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
something fails, and say, "We're going

561
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,039
to bring this forward. This didn't work.

562
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
This failed. This is why." And maybe

563
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,640
somebody's going to have an idea of how

564
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,640
to rescue that and prevent it from

565
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
failure or agree that this is something

566
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
we should not continue to pursue because

567
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,280
there are failures in science. and we

568
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,280
need to be prepared for that. Um we

569
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,320
share and in that we share both positive

570
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,240
and negative data. So we had over fif

571
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
150 people in attendance at the

572
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,400
symposium including researchers,

573
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,799
clinicians, uh regulators and industry

574
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,640
members, 10 lightning scientific talks

575
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,840
and over 30 posters in the poster

576
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
session that you're going to see also

577
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,360
yourselves um after this meeting which

578
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,240
was really exciting and the take-home

579
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,840
from that was that um we had a

580
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,159
presentation from Dave Dave Seagull on

581
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,240
crisper cast 13 as a gene editing

582
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,159
strategy that we've been supporting um

583
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
for the last few years and ultimately

584
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,880
there was a decision made that this was

585
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,640
a no-go decision. ision and that this

586
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,880
program didn't look like it had

587
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
superiority or advancement in what is

588
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,000
currently being developed and we were

589
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,240
not going to continue furthering that

590
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,240
program. Um, and that was that was a

591
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,559
really great talk to show how and why

592
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,640
they made that decision. Um, followed by

593
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,240
a talk on Zincfinger showing how on the

594
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,400
opposite end how that's looking really

595
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,640
good and we're really seeing some um

596
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,720
potential candidates, drug candidates

597
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,880
for humans that could potentially knock

598
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,760
down that anti-sense and upregulate the

599
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,120
copy of that UB3 gene. Um, we heard a

600
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,840
talk from Eric Lavine about the

601
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,360
importance of genes outside of UB3A in

602
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
the deletion and how we can think about

603
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,360
measuring up regulation and the impact

604
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,360
and effect of those genes. Um, and we

605
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,320
heard a talk from Brown University by

606
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,919
Alvin Wang about the function of of

607
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,400
something called autophagy and brain

608
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,600
health and how some drugs can improve

609
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,960
autophagy and neuronal function. Um, we

610
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
heard from North Carolina State

611
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,240
University team and you'll hear more

612
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,240
about that today about a new assay that

613
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,640
they developed called the ubiquination

614
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,720
assay to measure the function of a gene

615
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,919
therapy or of a protein therapy and how

616
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,200
that UB3A protein is working. And we

617
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,720
heard some great talks and you're going

618
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,360
to hear some of them this afternoon as

619
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,840
well about how people are really trying

620
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,880
hard to detect UB3A in the CSF.

621
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,559
Jennifer's going to talk a little bit

622
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,919
more about that in the next talk, so I'm

623
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,159
not going to give anything away. But as

624
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,520
a potential future biioarker, which

625
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,600
she's going to explain to you what that

626
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,919
is, that can have really incredible

627
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,760
impact if we can find something like

628
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,480
that that works and can show us target

629
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,760
engagement in UB3A expression. Um, so we

630
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,200
were able to share all of that and

631
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,240
really learn from that, which was

632
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,360
incredible. And so with that, um, that's

633
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:04,000
a conclusion of 35 talks in nine hours

634
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,440
presented to you in 15 minutes. Um, but

635
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,960
thank you. Thank you for listening.

636
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,280
Thank you to our sponsors. Thank you to

637
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
everyone who was there yesterday. Um it

638
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,360
was a big day. It was a really important

639
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,559
day and I feel really proud of everyone

640
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,080
that really participated and engaged and

641
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,919
wants to advance the field in a very

642
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,919
very similar way. So thank you for that.
