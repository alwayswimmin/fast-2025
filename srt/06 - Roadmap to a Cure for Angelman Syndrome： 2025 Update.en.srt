1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,879
I'm excited to really kick off with the

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:09,040
roadmap to a cure. Um, firstly, I want

3
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,639
to start by thanking all of our amazing

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,400
sponsors for making yesterday, today,

5
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,119
and tomorrow possible for all of our

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,520
families to be here. A tremendous amount

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,400
of the support to get families here

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
through scholarships has been because of

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
our sponsors, particularly Mattiey's

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,880
Mission. So, I want to thank Mattiey's

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
mission for really bringing families

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,960
here and supporting that effort. People

13
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,880
have come up to me.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,520
People have come up to me just so

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,079
grateful for the opportunity to sit in

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,480
this room and of course it's our

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,239
obligation for you to be in this room,

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,640
but really we couldn't do it without the

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,520
support of our sponsors. Um we you

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
you'll see sponsorship um titles around

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,199
the room and around the event, but

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
please thank the sponsors. We couldn't

23
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,359
get this done without them. This is

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,280
incredibly expensive, but it's a weekend

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
that all of the families deserve. So,

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,799
thank you. Um in addition, I want to

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,600
thank our team, uh the fast team,

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,560
particularly Laura. Uh Laura Faliano has

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,720
unbelievable ability to run a meeting.

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,479
And just so you know, like the heavy

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,400
lift of this has really been on Laura.

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,439
And so Laura, I don't know where you are

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,880
because I can't see anything, but um I

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,080
would like to acknowledge you if you're

35
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,759
here. So please stand if you are. And

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,159
she's probably back there. And if she's

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,200
not, let's just clap for Laura because

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,560
Laura has been amazing. Thank you,

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,360
Laura. We love you deeply. Um and

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,280
lastly, I would like everyone in the

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,600
room to raise their hand if they are a

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,600
family member.

43
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,520
All right. So, everyone look around.

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,040
These are our family members. Raise your

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,040
hand if you're a research scientist.

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,399
Raise your hand if you're an industry

47
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,399
member.

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,200
Awesome. So what you can see is that we

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,599
have every stakeholder in the room,

50
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,160
mostly families, but also researchers

51
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,200
and industry that's here to learn from

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,319
us and learn from you. And it's really

53
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,840
important that we share our story. And

54
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:28,480
so engage and talk and learn and really

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,760
learn about what these people are doing

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,319
here. and to industry and researchers

57
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,120
learn about why parents are here and

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,760
they care deeply for advancing therapies

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
for Angelmen syndrome. So, as most of

60
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,000
you know, um my name is Allison Brent

61
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,640
and I serve as the chief science officer

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,040
for FAST. Um I have a couple of roles

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,879
that I play. I'm also the co-director um

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,280
with my co-patriot Jennifer Panagulius

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
who you'll meet shortly who um for the

66
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Angelmen Syndrome Biomarker and Outcome

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
Measure Consortium. And we're going to

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,120
go over later today the learnings from

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
that closed door meeting that we had

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
yesterday which I hope was incredibly

71
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
successful. I also stood on the stage a

72
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
lot of the time so I couldn't tell if

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
people enjoyed it but I certainly

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,159
enjoyed it so I hope everybody else did

75
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,120
as well. So we'll share the learnings

76
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,280
from that meeting yesterday. Um I also

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
am the co-director of the international

78
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,280
Angelman Syndrome Research Council which

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,040
is a um a pre-ompetitive collaborative

80
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,239
consortium where we are leading a group

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680
of basically um experts around the world

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,200
that are not only working in Angelmen

83
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
syndrome but other neurodedevelopmental

84
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
disorders in order to learn and to fill

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,640
our gaps and understand our gap

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,799
analysis. Um, and I am the chief

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,200
development officer of the accelerator

88
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,760
that Fast started called AS2 Bio, which

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,360
we'll talk a little bit about today. And

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
most importantly, I am the mother to

91
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,920
three beautiful little girls. And this

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,879
is Quincy. She is 11 years old and she

93
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,680
lives with Angelmen syndrome.

94
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,200
Here are my disclosures.

95
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,799
So, we heard a lot about the basics, but

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,439
now I'm going to talk about the basics

97
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,799
of Angelmen syndrome and hopefully

98
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,799
everything you learned in the last

99
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,959
session will prepare you and give you

100
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,359
the tools to understand everything that

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
I'm going to say as well. So, Angelman

102
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,600
syndrome

103
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,440
involves a single gene on a single

104
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,080
chromosome. And as you learned, there

105
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,639
are 46 chromosomes in most of our cells.

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,720
23 pairs. one that comes from mom or

107
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,440
maternal and then one that comes from

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,479
dad or paternal

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,120
and it's caused by a severe reduction in

110
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:46,160
a single gene that is called ub3a

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,240
and that gene sits on the 15th

112
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,520
chromosome.

113
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,199
It affects approximately 1 in 12 to

114
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,000
15,000 people which could be 500,000

115
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,600
people in the world

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and it's usually random. None of us or

117
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,880
very few of us are carriers for this.

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,199
There are some but very few are carriers

119
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,800
for this. It happens randomly in the egg

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:19,440
usually before fertilization.

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:22,160
So this happened likely in mom's egg

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,680
when she was being developed in her

123
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,120
mother's body, which means that this is

124
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,919
before we were even born that this egg

125
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:38,720
developed this mutation, a deletion or a

126
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,039
a changing of the letters of the gene.

127
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,280
Each chromosome, as you learned, is made

128
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:49,120
up of tons of genes, over 20,000 genes

129
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:52,160
per chromosome. And it codes for

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,680
different proteins in the body. So,

131
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,759
every gene that causes disease usually

132
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,639
is associated with some protein that's

133
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,240
not being made at all or it's not being

134
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,560
made well and ultimately results in a

135
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,919
change of function. So, we learned that

136
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,479
this morning, but hopefully we can

137
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,560
relate this to Angelman syndrome. And

138
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,759
so, let's blow that up a little bit.

139
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,639
Okay, here's the 15th chromosome.

140
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,600
And our cells have one copy from mom and

141
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,800
one copy from dad. And if we make that

142
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,840
into a schematic, what you can see is

143
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:34,160
that in neurons only,

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,440
the copy from dad in me, in you, and in

145
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,960
our children is silenced. It's silenced

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,280
by something called a long non-oding

147
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,280
RNA. Complicated. You may see it as UB3A

148
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,000
anti-sense

149
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:56,160
or the stop.

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,160
It stops the expression of the UB3 gene

151
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,560
in the neurons on the father's copy of

152
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,639
the gene.

153
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:09,199
But with Angelman syndrome, the mother's

154
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,680
copy is not being read

155
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,319
in all of the cells.

156
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,360
In you and I, our mother's copy is being

157
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,280
read in the neurons. The father's copy

158
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,479
is silent in the neurons. And we have

159
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,840
normal function. Well, you can make that

160
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
decision. Somewhat normal function.

161
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,599
But

162
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,599
in our kids with Angelmen, the mother's

163
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,560
copy is generally not being read or it's

164
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:37,759
deleted. And therefore, they don't have

165
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,800
expression of the UB3 gene resulting, as

166
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,479
you learned from Emma, the UB3 protein.

167
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,639
Because the father's copy is silent, the

168
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,599
mother's copy is gone. Therefore,

169
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,440
they're null. the neurons have nothing.

170
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,840
But in the rest of the body, the

171
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,520
father's copy is not silent. So they're

172
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,879
expressing the gene and therefore it's

173
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,879
only a disorder of neurons.

174
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,759
So this can happen in various different

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,440
ways which we're going to hear more

176
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,360
about later, but some and the most

177
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,319
common way is a deletion of a segment of

178
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,680
the mother's copy of that gene.

179
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,879
The next most common way is a mutation

180
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,360
within the UB3 gene, meaning a letter is

181
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:30,960
misspelled or a little piece is missing

182
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,080
or a little piece is added, making the

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,000
gene not read well, which makes them not

184
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,279
make a protein.

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,719
In a small proportion, the silencing of

186
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,440
the father's copy is also silenced on

187
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,519
the mother's copy. And that's an

188
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,279
imprinting center defect or UPD where

189
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,959
instead of a mother's copy and a

190
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,920
father's copy, there happens to be two

191
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,600
father's copies. And that means they're

192
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:05,120
both silent. Again, the result being a

193
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,680
lack of expression of UB3A in neurons.

194
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,440
And then there's one group, a very small

195
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,880
proportion of the population that has

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,360
something called mosaicism.

197
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,839
And that is an incredibly rare group,

198
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,200
but that group ultimately is a key to a

199
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,519
lot of information that we'll talk

200
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,959
about. And what that means is that it

201
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,399
didn't happen at the egg stage,

202
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:34,720
but the mutation or whatever went wrong

203
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:38,399
happened after the egg and the sperm

204
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,080
fertilized in the embryo. So it happened

205
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,560
very early. But what happens is that

206
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,600
most of the cells of the body are not

207
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,920
expressing maternal UB3A but some of

208
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,080
them are and we'll talk about that.

209
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,839
So the function I don't need to tell you

210
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,720
now which is wonderful because you've

211
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,480
just learned that right EV3 is an enzyme

212
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:05,120
the the E3 liase it tags proteins for

213
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,040
degradation or to keep them around for

214
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,519
longer and by doing that it allows for

215
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,000
neurons all of those proteins being

216
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,880
cleaned up in that space allows for

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,959
neurons to communicate well and if you

218
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,600
have too many of one protein or not

219
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,480
enough of another protein the neurons

220
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,880
are not going to communicate very well.

221
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,240
And that results in the symptoms of

222
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,480
Angelmen syndrome. And th that cleanup

223
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,200
and that that what we call homeostasis

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,519
is required for normal neuron function

225
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,640
in the brain. And our neurons are what

226
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:44,320
allow our brain to think, allow our

227
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,600
muscles to move, allow us to perform all

228
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,880
of the functions that we do. So this is

229
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,399
called, you may hear the word

230
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,480
synaptopathy.

231
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,760
It's it's called that because the

232
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,120
communication between two neurons is

233
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,160
what is abnormal. And so the syninnapse

234
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,040
is that junction where one neuron is

235
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,160
talking to another neuron. And those two

236
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,079
neurons need to speak because the second

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,880
neuron talks to our muscles. And if we

238
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,440
can't get the message from the first

239
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,200
neuron to our muscles, how are we going

240
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,880
to walk? How are we going to talk?

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,680
How are we going to rest, sleep?

242
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,440
All of our functions are intrinsic and

243
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,839
depend upon neuronal communication. And

244
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,720
that is disturbed when you don't have

245
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,800
normal function at that area, the

246
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,880
syninnapse,

247
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,399
and it results in the symptoms of

248
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,279
Angelmen. If we can't communicate one

249
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,160
neuron to our muscle to say when I take

250
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,720
a step I'm going to activate this leg

251
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,200
and relax this leg and now I'm going to

252
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,000
activate this leg and relax that leg.

253
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,360
That's communication. And if we can't do

254
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,480
that quickly as the neurons are firing

255
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,120
in milliseconds, micros secondsonds,

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,279
then how are we going to coordinate

257
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,480
thousands of muscles in our face, our

258
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,320
tongue, and our voice box to say a

259
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,839
single word?

260
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,639
That's all communication of nerves to

261
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,079
muscles. So you can imagine how if you

262
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,839
don't have that communication, you have

263
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,240
this buildup of proteins in that space.

264
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,959
Things are going to seem very foggy.

265
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,399
Things are going to be very slow and

266
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,959
things are not going to be able to

267
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,440
communicate at a pace in which normal

268
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:41,360
function can happen and that results in

269
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,680
the symptoms of Angelmen syndrome.

270
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,880
One thing I'd like to highlight is that

271
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,560
a majority of the population has a

272
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,240
genotype of deletion.

273
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:57,120
Deletion means an entire segment, not

274
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,200
just the gene, has been deleted. Now,

275
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,120
there is something called an introgenic

276
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,519
deletion, meaning there's only a

277
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
deletion within the gene. And we we

278
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,200
bucket that with mutation because it's

279
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
only affecting the UB3 gene. And I know

280
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,959
a parent in the community had a question

281
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,399
about that.

282
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,440
The deletion generally involves a big

283
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,800
segment of the chromosome. So if we blow

284
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,160
that out, here's the UB3A gene. Here's

285
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,680
the big segment that's been deleted.

286
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:34,160
So this could be like six million base

287
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,920
pairs of DNA. Imagine that. six million

288
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,800
base pairs of DNA that have just been

289
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,920
deleted, gone. Where a mutation might be

290
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,519
one base pair of DNA that's the wrong

291
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,519
letter.

292
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,480
That's the difference between a deletion

293
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:52,560
and a mutation. So it's important we

294
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,920
understand that because with deletion we

295
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,680
have all of these genes that are sitting

296
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,800
around UB3A that are missing that may

297
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,720
have some function that contribute to

298
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,120
why individuals with a deletion of

299
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
Angelmen syndrome may be a little bit

300
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,639
more symptomatic

301
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,079
than those with a mutation or UPD or ICD

302
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,240
where they're not missing these other

303
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,800
genes. Well, let's talk about those

304
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,720
other genes a little bit.

305
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,160
There are the GABA genes that we hear

306
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,839
about. All of these genes may contribute

307
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,399
to seizures, to sleep, to motor

308
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,480
function. And so, we don't want to

309
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,720
forget about those genes because as

310
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,320
we've moved toward addressing replacing

311
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
UB3A,

312
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,240
we really need to move toward thinking

313
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,120
about addressing these other genes

314
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,440
outside of UB3A.

315
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,000
And when we think about those genes, we

316
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,320
want to dig into the literature and say

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,040
which of them actually have clinical

318
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,480
function. Right? Our kids are missing

319
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,480
half of their copies of those extra

320
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,600
genes. They're fully missing UB3A in

321
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,160
neurons, but those other genes are not

322
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,120
silenced. So they're being expressed on

323
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,399
the father's copy. They're just not

324
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,399
being expressed on the mother's copy. So

325
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,360
if that's the case, we call that haplo

326
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,240
insufficiency or half of the expression

327
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,040
that they might need. So if we look at

328
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,880
those genes and we look into the

329
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,440
literature of the clinical signs

330
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,639
associated with those extra genes, what

331
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,880
we learn is not all of them likely are

332
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,079
related to disease.

333
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:40,480
The GABA genes, those two GABA genes do

334
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:43,360
seem to have some individuals that only

335
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,560
have mutations or loss of function of

336
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,880
one copy of those genes in which they

337
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,480
have some clinical symptoms. Those

338
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,000
symptoms might be associated with

339
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,079
seizures, some intellectual disability,

340
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,839
and maybe even some learning

341
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,320
disabilities.

342
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,959
Sleep may be impacted. So you can see

343
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,160
the overlap of the Angelman syndrome

344
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,000
symptoms and those genes. And so we

345
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,360
don't want to forget about them. But the

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,920
the two genes that rise to the top is

347
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,880
GABA B3 and GABA G3.

348
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,680
So we need to think about can we correct

349
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,519
those as well.

350
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,440
So with all of that in mind, UB3 alone

351
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,160
without even thinking about those extra

352
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,120
genes results in all of the symptoms we

353
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,720
live with. And just to educate those who

354
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,480
don't live with Angelmen syndrome,

355
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,839
because I do not need to educate those

356
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,120
of us that do, it is associated with a

357
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
universal lack of speech, significant

358
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,680
sleep disturbance,

359
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,800
a taxian incoordination where some

360
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,880
individuals don't even walk,

361
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,519
impulsive and hyperactive behaviors.

362
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,839
Sometimes that can lead to aggression

363
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,560
and frustration,

364
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,319
an inability to live an independent

365
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,079
life,

366
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,439
and all of the activities of daily

367
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,959
living that are tremendously impacted.

368
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:18,880
But what I don't want anyone to forget

369
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:21,679
is the impact it has on us parents.

370
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,240
Inability to maintain employment,

371
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,120
loss of sleep, anxiety, social

372
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,600
isolation,

373
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,080
fatigue, chronic fatigue. Imagine

374
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,039
sleeping 3 to four hours a night. Not

375
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:40,559
just during the newborn years, but for

376
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:43,919
25, 35, 45, 55 years. Because our kids

377
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:47,120
are not degenerative and they live a

378
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,240
normal length of life. We believe just

379
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,160
not a normal quality of life. And who is

380
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,320
impacted by their lack of sleep? Of

381
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,919
course, they are. But what about every

382
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,640
caregiver that has to take care of them

383
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,240
for the rest of their life? That is

384
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,000
profoundly impactful to families. So,

385
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,760
I'm speaking to the drug developers in

386
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,520
the room. When we think about the

387
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,000
symptoms we're addressing, we cannot

388
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,480
forget about the impact that these

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,440
symptoms have on families. And that is

390
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,160
what meaningful is. How can we address

391
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,039
the symptoms of this disorder that are

392
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:25,120
meaningful to families?

393
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,480
It's not always only to the child or to

394
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
the adult that's living with Angelman

395
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,200
syndrome.

396
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,440
So, I mentioned mosaicism and I'm going

397
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,640
to go back to that because anybody in

398
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
this room that has a child with

399
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,600
mosaicism, I just want to thank you

400
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,960
because you certainly when we got our

401
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:46,480
diagnosis saved my life.

402
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,480
When I learned the capacity of

403
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,799
individuals

404
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:55,039
that are expressing

405
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:59,600
one to five% of maternal UB3A in their

406
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:04,080
cells, meaning 99 to 95%

407
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,400
is gone. They only have 1 to 5%.

408
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,000
Those individuals

409
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,880
may have some speech.

410
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,600
They don't have seizures and they walk

411
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,520
beautifully.

412
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,880
That's a different child to the 99% of

413
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,559
us where our kids live with no maternal

414
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,080
UB3A.

415
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,360
What does that tell me? 20%

416
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,120
they can speak in sentences potentially

417
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,720
and 40% may not even be diagnosed

418
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,919
because they are mistaken as

419
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:43,600
neurotypical. Imagine that. Imagine

420
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:46,880
that. And what that tells me as a doctor

421
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,799
is that we don't need a lot to make a

422
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,760
huge difference.

423
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,960
Of course, I want 40% or more because I

424
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,039
want a neurotypical child. We all do

425
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,760
or many of us do. But 1 to 5% is a

426
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,280
quality of life improvement that I dream

427
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,400
about

428
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,000
and I think most of us do. And we

429
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,559
learned that because of the mosaic

430
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,640
children and adults. And so for that,

431
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,160
I'm grateful. But it allowed us to think

432
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,039
about drug development in a little bit

433
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,720
of a different way.

434
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,160
So how are we going to get there? How

435
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,559
are we going to address it? So this is

436
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,919
the road map. Okay. We used to have four

437
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,840
pillars and I'm going to explain the

438
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,480
five pillars, but your book has

439
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,799
everything in there about the pillars

440
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,320
and the why. So we can replace the

441
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:40,480
missing UB3 gene or protein

442
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,280
pillar one. We can unsilence the

443
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,360
paternal alil

444
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,240
pillar two.

445
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,200
By unsilencing it, we will allow it to

446
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,840
be read in neurons, which is essentially

447
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,640
similar to replacing it, but it's a

448
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,840
different strategy on how we think about

449
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,760
the molecular way to address that.

450
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:08,159
Pillar three is thinking about the genes

451
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:10,799
outside of UB3A for the deletion for UPD

452
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,679
and ICD because they all have different

453
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,840
genes that are probably contributing to

454
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,960
the phenotype and those genotypes that

455
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,760
are different than mutation.

456
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,159
Pillar four, everything we learned about

457
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,120
from Dr. Margolus about the downstream

458
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,200
targets. How do the downstream targets

459
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,120
affect

460
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,240
the function of the syninnapse and the

461
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,880
neurons and can we hit those targets in

462
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,280
a way that could benefit individuals

463
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,440
with Angelmen syndrome? And then

464
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,000
finally, pillar five is all the things

465
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,679
we need to do to set up and be prepared

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
for clinical trials in Angelmen

467
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
syndrome.

468
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,960
So

469
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,600
this is just a a gateway into everybody

470
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,919
working on this pillar one AAV gene

471
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,520
replacement therapy.

472
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,120
Lentivirus hematopoetic stem cell gene

473
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
therapy. I know these words sound really

474
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,280
big and scary, but we're going to go

475
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,320
through them one at a time. Enzyme

476
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,159
replacement therapy. All of those are to

477
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:20,159
replace the UB3A gene that is missing.

478
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,320
Pillar one. Pillar two, stop the stop.

479
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
Unsilence the father's copy of that

480
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,840
gene.

481
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,120
We can do that with an anti-sense

482
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,480
olonucleotide or ASO. It's all in your

483
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,120
glossery. Don't be overwhelmed. Just

484
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,960
listen and absorb. It's all in there.

485
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,720
You're going to be hit by this time and

486
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,080
time again over the next two days. I

487
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,640
promise you, you're going to walk out of

488
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,919
here and you're going to understand it.

489
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,440
Artificial transcription factors,

490
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,520
crisper gene editing,

491
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,840
and mirna

492
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,679
or sirna.

493
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:01,679
All of those technologies can unsilence

494
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,880
the father's copy of that gene.

495
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,600
How are we going to deal with those

496
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,520
genes outside of UB3A?

497
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,320
We're going to hear a talk later this

498
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,080
afternoon about how we can crisper

499
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,039
activate and turn up the notch of those

500
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:20,159
hapluins sufficient genes to increase

501
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:22,080
their expression on the father's copy in

502
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:28,159
which they are read because it's not

503
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,159
UB3A and we can increase that expression

504
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,280
downstream targeting we have small

505
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,440
molecules like drugs from neurin we're

506
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,240
going to hear a lecture from helix about

507
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,960
some drugs they're working on from RO

508
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,280
and from Brown University

509
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,360
and then critically preparing for

510
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,120
clinical trials which are all the ways

511
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,960
in which we have the models that we've

512
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,200
developed the endpoints and the

513
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,400
biomarkers that we're working so heavily

514
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,559
on and ensuring we have policy and

515
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,400
regulatory strategy so that the

516
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,120
regulators hear what we're doing and

517
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,200
help to support it.

518
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,720
So that's another way of looking at it

519
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:11,279
which is in your your program is those

520
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,679
five pillars maternal replacement

521
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,919
unsilencing dad

522
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,799
adjacent genes

523
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,559
downstream targets. Let's get prepared

524
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,600
to accelerate toward human application.

525
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,600
Let's start with pillar one.

526
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:35,360
That's a neuron and we need to get UB3A

527
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,120
into that neuron because it's missing.

528
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,799
And there are a couple of ways that we

529
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,679
can do that. One being with AAV gene

530
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,279
replacement therapy where we take a

531
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,159
virus which is a healthy virus where the

532
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,600
bad parts have been taken out of it and

533
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,520
we deposit the UB3 gene inside that

534
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,640
virus.

535
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,360
That virus is then injected into the

536
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,799
fluid around the brain, whether that's

537
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,600
through the fluid at the base of the

538
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,679
skull or the fluid through the brain

539
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,080
into the ventricle.

540
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,080
Or we're going to hear a talk tomorrow

541
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,200
about the potential to actually inject

542
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,320
it in the veins and the virus can cross

543
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,200
the bloodb brain barrier, go from the

544
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,600
veins to the brain. That would be

545
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,520
amazing and we'll talk about that. But

546
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,679
that's really something that doesn't

547
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,159
have yet that path in humans. We don't

548
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,039
have that long track record yet for that

549
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,919
very new and very exciting technology.

550
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,640
We'll talk more about that as well.

551
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,159
We can do it a different way. We can

552
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,559
take cells, as Emma showed you, outside

553
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:51,520
the body, our own blood cells.

554
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:54,400
We can put the UB3 gene into those blood

555
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,000
cells in a dish.

556
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,159
Then we can put them back into the body

557
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,200
if we make a little space for them in

558
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,400
our bone marrow for them to deposit and

559
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,400
create a factory in our bone marrow to

560
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,080
then release the cells out of the bone

561
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
marrow, the blood cells. They're called

562
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,440
blood stem cells.

563
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,279
And those blood stem cells cross the

564
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,440
bloodb brain barrier, go into the brain,

565
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,320
distribute throughout the brain,

566
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,559
touching almost every neuron, and

567
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,159
release UB3A

568
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,679
to get into those neurons to be read for

569
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,919
that protein to function. So that's

570
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,760
called hematopoetic

571
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,360
stem cell gene therapy. And then enzyme

572
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,600
replacement therapy. What if we can take

573
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
the UB3 protein and just put it into the

574
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,559
brain? So, we're going to hear about

575
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,279
that as well.

576
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,640
So, gene replacement therapy. You don't

577
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,480
need to read this slide because I'm just

578
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,240
going to summarize it for you. But what

579
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,880
I want you to see is that so much work

580
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,440
and time and money has gone into this

581
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,520
because of you. You have funded all of

582
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,400
these experiments and these are animal

583
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,279
experiments. These are mouse experiments

584
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,200
and we also have now monkey experiments

585
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:18,400
showing that if you replace the UB3A

586
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,720
gene, you can correct the behaviors of

587
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,760
the mouse that may be somewhat

588
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,240
translational to people. And we can do

589
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,760
that with AAV gene replacement therapy.

590
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:32,559
So what you can see is that the graphs

591
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,279
you're going to see high, low, high,

592
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:38,080
right? when you see correction to wild

593
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,480
type or normal which Dr. Samako

594
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,279
explained to us wild type is the normal

595
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,559
mouse or the neurotypical mouse. If we

596
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,120
can get back toward neurotypical and

597
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,960
away from Angelman syndrome, we are

598
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,440
improving the behaviors of these mice

599
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,880
with these technologies. And so this

600
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,520
gene therapy on the top is the AAV, at

601
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,679
the bottom is the HSC, but you don't

602
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,559
really care about that. I think you care

603
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,640
a little bit more about this where let's

604
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,120
just look at the reality of it. Right?

605
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,039
So this is a program the hematopoetic

606
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,960
stem cell gene replacement therapy where

607
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,440
you can see a mouse on the left with

608
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,880
Angelman syndrome

609
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,120
and that mouse is having a hard time.

610
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,399
He can't keep up. He's hitting his back

611
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,520
legs. He's maintained in this system but

612
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:31,840
he's really falling behind in a single

613
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,960
mouse after gene replacement therapy

614
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,080
using hematopetic stem cells. Look at

615
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,320
that same mouse.

616
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,039
Doesn't take a scientist to look at that

617
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,120
and say, "Well, hell, can you do that to

618
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:48,240
my daughter? I'd like her to walk like

619
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,480
that." So, you can see the benefit of

620
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,279
these animal models to show us the

621
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,200
possibility of improving gate, for

622
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,640
example.

623
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,159
One thing about this program, which

624
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,039
we've been funding since 2016, is that

625
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,159
it used something called an MNDU3

626
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,320
promoter. Well, you don't care about

627
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,080
that. And Dr. Kon is going to talk to us

628
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,440
about that tomorrow. He's our keynote in

629
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,440
the morning and I really encourage you

630
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360
to come and listen to this talk because

631
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,320
it's really important for you to

632
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,399
understand this. But we had to change

633
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,039
this promoter because this promoter was

634
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,880
associated with some safety challenges

635
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,960
in the clinic in humans with other

636
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
programs not in Angelmen syndrome. So

637
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,320
before we went to Angelman syndrome, we

638
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,399
said we're not going to use the

639
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,799
promiscuous promoter that might have

640
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,320
risk. We're going to find promoters that

641
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,559
have 15 or 20 years of experience where

642
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,200
we can feel the safety track record is

643
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,799
stronger. So, let's see what can we do

644
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
with the new promoters. Well, I want you

645
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,760
to look at the top left, which is a wild

646
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,200
type or neurotypical mouse. I'm going to

647
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,919
have you look at the top right, which is

648
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,840
an Angelman mouse, and the bottom left

649
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:57,120
and the bottom right are two new

650
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,039
promoters that we have that have a

651
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,480
better safety track record than the

652
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,960
prior promoter that was done in that

653
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,080
early work. So, look here, top left, top

654
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,679
right, bottom left, bottom right. You

655
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,840
could see the wild type mouse is getting

656
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,640
to the end with no trouble. Promoter one

657
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,480
and promoter two are having a race and

658
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
Angelmen untreated is having a really

659
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,320
hard time.

660
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,200
Doesn't take a scientist to look at that

661
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,080
and say that's different.

662
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,240
We've corrected the balance and motor

663
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,760
function of that mouse, that single

664
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:34,880
mouse. When you see profound effect like

665
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,679
that, it gets you really excited that

666
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,720
there's the possibility

667
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,559
of this type of therapy improving the

668
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:48,399
symptoms of Angelman syndrome.

669
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,159
What gets me more excited than that as a

670
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,360
as someone who understands the research

671
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,559
is to say, okay, Angelman's at the top.

672
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,120
Look at UB3A, which is the third column

673
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,520
where there's no green.

674
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,039
Neurotypical, you see green, the wild

675
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,960
type mouse. Promoter one and promoter 2,

676
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,799
I think I see green. Well, the green is

677
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,720
UB3A.

678
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,200
Well, hold on. Let's dive in a little

679
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,440
bit more. I see a lot of UB3A. And it

680
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,960
looks like the red are the neurons and

681
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,760
the UB3A is in the neurons. All right,

682
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,039
let's dig in a little bit more. Wow,

683
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,720
there's a lot of UB3 in those neurons.

684
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:29,279
And that's why you can see the behavior

685
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,440
of those mice gets so much better

686
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,760
because this is a mouse. And remember, a

687
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,399
mouse is not a human. And we don't know

688
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:41,360
how this will translate to humans. But

689
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,440
what we do know is that I call this the

690
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,519
field of puppies

691
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,080
because that's what it looks like. And

692
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,080
that's very exciting to see because with

693
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,480
most therapies, we don't see that. And

694
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,480
so that's an exciting program all

695
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,559
because of you and your funding to help

696
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,679
support it.

697
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,399
Let's move to pillar two. Pillar two is

698
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,120
on silencing the father's copy of the

699
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,120
gene. You could do that like I said with

700
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,039
anti-sense, oligos, zinc, fingers,

701
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,960
mirna, shrna, sirna, crisper. So many

702
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,039
things. I can roll these terms off my

703
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,039
tongue because you guys now know what

704
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:21,760
they are thanks to the education that

705
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,519
you got this morning. Let's unsilence

706
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,880
that father's copy. Well, how do we do

707
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,880
that? And how does that look in the

708
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,679
animal models? ASOS can rescue phenotype

709
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,880
in the animal model. In an adult, there

710
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,480
was some of the phenotype that was

711
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,760
corrected.

712
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,320
So, we have optimism that in older

713
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,080
animals, maybe we can see benefit. And

714
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,399
that was enough for us to be able to

715
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,840
push that through to human application,

716
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,120
which we'll talk about, which is

717
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,679
incredibly exciting. Zinc fingers, we

718
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,519
were able to see that we can unsilence

719
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,600
the father's copy, and you could see the

720
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,960
brown at the top, no brown in the

721
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,960
middle, and the brown at the bottom.

722
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,760
What does that mean? UB3A has been

723
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,919
restored into the neurons of the brain.

724
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,640
That's exciting. That's a positive

725
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,880
result. And then it also corrected the

726
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,600
behaviors in the mouse model of Angelmen

727
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,799
syndrome. So super exciting. What about

728
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,399
crisper gene editing? Same thing. These

729
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:18,399
slides don't mean anything to you in

730
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,159
terms of you see a high black bar, you

731
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,720
see a very low white bar, and you see an

732
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,200
in between gray bar. The in between gray

733
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,320
bar is what was corrected in one

734
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,440
experiment using AAV crisper delivery in

735
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,480
order to deliver the editor to the brain

736
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,200
and and um deliver UB unsilence and

737
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,480
deliver UB3A to those to those neurons.

738
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,080
And then on the right you can see that

739
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,960
there's lots of bars of correcting the

740
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,960
phenotype of UB3A of uh Angelman

741
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,480
syndrome in the mice. But this probably

742
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,320
means a little more to you. And this is

743
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,159
my favorite video. Sorry Shauna. I know

744
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,720
this is your video and I steal it every

745
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,720
time. But it's so important for families

746
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,480
to see. We have the wild type mouse on

747
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,039
the left, the untreated Angelman mouse

748
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,519
in the middle. Oops. And the angelman

749
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,519
treated mouse on the right. What's more

750
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
important to me in this video, similar

751
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,839
to the other video for HSSE gene

752
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:14,240
therapy, is that these are adult mice,

753
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:17,280
not newborn mice, not neonatal mice, not

754
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,760
mice that are in uterero. These are

755
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,879
adult mice, adolescent mice, teenage

756
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,760
mice that are having benefit after

757
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,760
birth, well after birth in order to

758
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,520
rescue these phenotypes. We don't know

759
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,560
how that will behave in humans. We have

760
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,119
no idea, but we don't know it won't

761
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,960
improve phenotype in humans. And the

762
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,359
only way we're going to know is if we

763
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,879
try. And there's reason to believe based

764
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:42,960
on what you're going to hear tomorrow

765
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,359
with the ASOS and clinical trials in

766
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,280
both adults, young children, and

767
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,440
adolescence that benefit is being seen

768
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,839
across the board for all individuals

769
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,480
living with Angelman syndrome. And so

770
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,079
that's really optimistic that maybe that

771
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,040
therapeutic window that a lot of people

772
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,200
like to talk about is different for

773
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,960
neurodedevelopmental disorders than it

774
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,079
is for neurodeenerative disorders.

775
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,119
Let's talk about pillar three. Pillar

776
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,960
three we have a program where we are

777
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:15,520
upregulating

778
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,680
the haplo insufficient genes in the

779
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,160
deletion genotype. We already talked

780
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
about that. This is a group out of UCSF.

781
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,599
Um Dr. Dr. Nadavatio is going to talk to

782
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,440
us later today about the program that

783
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,160
we're working with a collaboration

784
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,320
between Yale University, North Carolina

785
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,480
State and University of California, San

786
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,839
Francisco. And this is where we're

787
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,760
upregulating those genes to try to see

788
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:42,480
if we can have a benefit in improving

789
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,000
the the expression of some of those

790
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,359
genes. And I'm not going to give it

791
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,680
away. I'm going to let him share his

792
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,680
data. But what you can see here is that

793
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,760
we have found constructs for humans that

794
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,320
can increase expression of those genes

795
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,440
that we think really matter, which is

796
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:03,359
very exciting. And then finally, pillar

797
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,640
four, those downstream targets.

798
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,640
Each one of these downstream targets has

799
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,160
a different path that they are

800
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,960
addressing. And we learned that there

801
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,440
are thousands of paths that we might be

802
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,480
able to address. And each one of these

803
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,680
programs, Nurin UN, uh, Brown

804
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,320
University, BDNF Analog, OPC, OPC

805
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,680
rescue, Aloabat from from RO that

806
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,040
they're going to talk about tomorrow,

807
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,359
and Helix you're going to hear about

808
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,760
later today. All talking about different

809
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,400
constructs that might affect the synapse

810
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,400
and improve function.

811
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,720
And then finally, where does that put

812
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,480
us? It puts us to say, this is

813
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,640
overwhelming. there's a whole lot to be

814
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,320
excited about, but how do we compare

815
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,599
this to that or that to this? I don't

816
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:52,960
understand. And so, somebody did a a

817
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,240
study where they looked at if we knock

818
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:00,720
if we replace UB3A at different time

819
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:03,359
points prenatally at birth in a young

820
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,839
animal, in an adolescent animal, or in

821
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,280
an adult animal. You could see as they

822
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,839
get older, you get less rescue of the

823
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,560
behaviors, which led people to believe

824
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,920
the younger the better. And that that's

825
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,119
logical. But what's interesting is that

826
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,200
if you look at the actual therapeutic

827
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,160
modalities that are translational to

828
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,880
humans and you use the mouse model

829
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,280
that's truly translational to a human, a

830
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,160
mutation model of a mouse where their

831
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,480
UB3 gene is not functional. It's not

832
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,880
expressing on the maternal alil just

833
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,760
like a mutation in humans where the

834
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,400
other model is not that that model. um

835
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:49,599
and you actually give them AAV gene

836
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:53,920
therapy, HSC gene therapy, ASOS, crisper

837
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,640
gene editors, or ATFs. Well, wow, that

838
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,079
heat map looks a little different.

839
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,400
A lot less red, a lot more green.

840
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,920
Whether you're an adult, you're an

841
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,359
adolescent,

842
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,920
or you're a newborn, there's phenotypic

843
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,000
rescue at every age. And we have reason

844
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,599
to believe for for functions like

845
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,520
cognition, learning and memory, motor,

846
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,160
um, be apply, you know, behaviors, EEGs,

847
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,000
sleep, biomarkers. If we look at all of

848
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,720
the behaviors that we translate to

849
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,960
humans, there's reason to believe we

850
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,640
might be able to have a benefit in the

851
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,920
lives of all humans at all ages. The

852
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,400
only way we're going to know the answer

853
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,280
to that is when we test these therapies

854
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,920
in humans at all ages. And that's very

855
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,720
exciting. And so I just want to direct

856
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,760
you on your table. There's a journal

857
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,400
that fast started thanks to Ed Weieber

858
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,079
called the Fast Dart Journal. Um so

859
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,160
basically this journal which you guys

860
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,880
can look at is going to be online

861
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,480
available to all in order to be able to

862
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,240
publish analyses, papers, and review

863
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,800
articles for Angelmen Syndrome that

864
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,640
could benefit our learnings. and it's

865
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,240
meant for the scientific community, but

866
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,119
everyone will have access to it because

867
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,119
it's free. And one paper that's in there

868
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:15,520
that I want you to take a look at that

869
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,040
I'm really, really proud of is this

870
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,119
metaanalysis

871
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,320
where we took all of the studies that

872
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,200
have been done, over 40 studies, put

873
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,160
them together, and said, "How do rodent

874
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,520
models define the potential for human

875
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,680
benefit?" a translational review for

876
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,839
Angelman Syndrome. Rather than people

877
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,920
and scientists picking one paper at a

878
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,440
time and trying to put it together to

879
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,079
make a story, we put it all together

880
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,400
very scientifically to say this is the

881
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,320
story. Look at that heat map.

882
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,839
The reinstatement model contradicts

883
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,440
the gene delivery model which is more

884
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,520
translational to our kids. And so we

885
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,040
really need the data in humans because

886
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,599
there's too much contradiction in

887
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,640
animals to truly understand what any of

888
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,520
that means. But there's possibilities.

889
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,800
There's potential to expect we might see

890
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:16,960
profound change. We also have a list of

891
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,400
all of the different phenotypes in these

892
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,200
animal models for the research

893
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,480
community. So you can understand what

894
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:27,440
model is testing what and how that

895
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,359
translates to humans and all of the

896
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,359
models that are out there. As Rodney

897
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,119
Smakco said earlier, we have way too

898
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,760
many models, but 95% of people use one

899
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,640
model and that is Dr. Jiang's model, the

900
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,760
mouse model that is a a imitation of a

901
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,560
mutation, nonfunctional loss of function

902
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,960
mutation from 1998.

903
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,599
And that's what most people use. So we

904
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,119
welcome you to take a look at that. So

905
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,760
now let's move to the fifth pillar,

906
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,880
accelerating and preparing for clinical

907
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:04,880
trials because those faces are what

908
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,960
matter and that's why we're here.

909
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,400
So the efforts to support clinical trial

910
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,839
readiness have been vast and incredibly

911
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,240
expensive and taken more time than

912
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,000
anybody ever thought. But we're getting

913
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,640
there and we're doing it. One of those

914
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,119
is creating the tools, the animal

915
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,359
models. We have rats and pigs and mice

916
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,880
galore. No more models, please. We're

917
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,319
good. Cell lines. We have every cell

918
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,280
line of every genotype that is available

919
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,440
pre-ompetitively for anybody to use at

920
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,720
Ebisk that any company could have access

921
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,599
to. That's nonproprietary. So nobody's

922
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,920
waiting for academic collaborations and

923
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,240
and and um research grants and

924
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,960
contracts. We made it available for

925
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,319
anybody to use at any time and that was

926
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,760
through a collaboration with Yale

927
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,319
University and Young Way is going to

928
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,319
talk about that this afternoon. Um, and

929
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:00,079
we have different ways. Organoids that

930
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,400
you saw earlier, these little mini

931
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,240
brains, all of those things you heard,

932
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,760
these are those in vitro tools.

933
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,520
And this is all on our website as well

934
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,880
for the research community that wants to

935
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,119
have access to this.

936
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,560
And then in sync international angelman

937
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,000
syndrome research council which I talked

938
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,160
to you about earlier is a collaboration

939
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,240
we have with the Simons Foundation with

940
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,800
the goal to fill gaps in Angelman

941
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:26,960
syndrome drug development and other

942
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,720
neurodedevelopmental disorders. So

943
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,760
Angelman syndrome happens to be

944
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,760
relatively far advanced in terms of drug

945
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,240
development activities compared to many

946
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,040
of these other newly diagnosed genetic

947
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,680
neurologic disorders. And it's unfair

948
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,319
for us to take everything we've learned

949
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,920
and live in a silo. So we invite other

950
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,040
neurodedevelopmental disorders to the

951
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,520
table to not only help advance them on

952
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,520
where they are, but they have learnings

953
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,520
that can help advance us on where we

954
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,359
are. Everyone goes at this from a

955
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,680
different angle. And if there's anything

956
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:01,200
that we can learn from them and they can

957
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,160
learn from us, we advance the field

958
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,680
together. And that's the only way for us

959
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,839
all to make a difference in the lives of

960
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,560
these individuals is to get out of our

961
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,640
silos, work together, and advance the

962
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,000
field. And this has allowed that to

963
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,160
happen in a really great way.

964
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Advocacy Day on the Hill. That's part of

965
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,240
our pillar five. Ryan's going to have a

966
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,480
talk lunch and learn today about this.

967
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,480
his efforts here and him and Jennifer

968
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,520
and Amanda Moore, she's hopefully in the

969
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,280
room somewhere, um have been incredible.

970
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,440
Getting you all out there and fighting

971
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,000
for what's right, fighting for what we

972
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,319
need in order to be able to improve the

973
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,200
lives of our children. That's been

974
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,560
incredible. The externally led patient

975
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,839
focused drug development meeting that

976
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:48,240
most of you participated in has been an

977
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,079
unbelievable wealth of information that

978
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,960
we've been able to leverage and our

979
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,960
entire day yesterday was around this

980
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,440
concept and Jennifer is going to talk to

981
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,359
you about that in the updated ABOM talk

982
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,040
shortly. So I don't want to give this

983
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:06,880
away but ultimately what we know is what

984
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,520
impacts our daily lives the most and

985
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,119
what are the priorities in impact for

986
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:17,280
treatments. And what was so clear for me

987
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,640
out of all of this was that what a

988
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,200
neurotypical family might consider a

989
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:28,000
minimal change

990
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,400
an Angelman family feels is profound. If

991
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,720
we can improve one domain,

992
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,520
communication,

993
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,040
independent living skills, motor

994
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,200
function,

995
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,200
sleep,

996
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,920
cognition,

997
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,760
we would take it because that any of

998
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:49,599
those things will improve our children's

999
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:53,760
lives and ours. And 342

1000
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,000
of you made that very clear. We cannot

1001
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,319
do that without you. and we are so

1002
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,920
grateful for your participation in these

1003
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,440
activities.

1004
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,520
And then we have a natural history

1005
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,760
study. Again, all of the work you

1006
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,680
families have put into this and I can't

1007
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,079
thank enough the natural history study

1008
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,560
teams at Boston Children's and Raidies

1009
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,720
and Colorado and, you know, all over

1010
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:19,920
Canada and the United States. These

1011
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:24,960
teams over 19 and a half years has put

1012
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:28,480
together data on over 650 of our kids

1013
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,839
over 19 and a half years to understand

1014
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,760
the trajectory of developmental change

1015
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,040
so that we can compare that to natural

1016
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,839
history data. And why is that important?

1017
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,880
Well, this is why.

1018
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:46,720
The top is the data presented last year

1019
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,960
by Ionis for the ASO clinical trial. And

1020
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,280
that study showed because it's open

1021
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,760
label, the only thing they can compare

1022
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,000
the treatment group to is the natural

1023
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,319
history of the disease. How did

1024
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,640
individuals not treated do compared to

1025
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,680
our individuals that were treated? On

1026
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,599
the bottom is the ultragenics data. And

1027
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,920
I'm not here to compare one to the

1028
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,480
other. All I'm here to show you is that

1029
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,119
on the top, black is the change in

1030
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,079
natural history over time. Red is the

1031
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:21,040
change in treated Angelmen patients

1032
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:23,520
after an ASO over time in cognition

1033
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,319
communication,

1034
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:28,640
the things we care most about. And you

1035
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,880
can see the trajectory both with the

1036
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,520
data at the top Ionis. The data at the

1037
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,800
bottom ultragenics just presented in two

1038
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:39,520
different ways that both of them have

1039
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,319
completely changed the trajectory

1040
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,240
compared to natural history. If we

1041
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,000
didn't have you all participating in

1042
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,079
those natural history studies for so

1043
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,680
long, there's no way we would have that

1044
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,319
data for them to say, I believe there's

1045
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,680
a potential treatment effect here. we

1046
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,079
are going to move into a phase three

1047
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,319
clinical trial which has to be a

1048
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:02,720
controlled study to truly prove if these

1049
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,280
drugs are working without that natural

1050
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,760
history data. That's just not possible.

1051
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,720
And this has been all thanks to our

1052
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:13,359
community, to the natural history team,

1053
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:16,400
to all of our sponsors, and the support

1054
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,319
and collaboration of the ABOM, which is

1055
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,640
the Angelman Syndrome Biomarker and

1056
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:22,400
Outcome Measure Consortium that was

1057
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,400
started as a collaboration between

1058
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,400
FastTompetitive

1059
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,760
space that Jennifer is going to talk

1060
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:35,440
about. And where we are today in 2025

1061
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:39,760
is that we've went from a $50,000 budget

1062
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:43,760
to having spent over $5.1 million on

1063
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,480
this since 2016. We have everybody

1064
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,119
around the table, including the FDA, who

1065
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,000
is supporting the efforts for

1066
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,480
understanding what is a minimal

1067
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,119
meaningful change. And Jennifer is going

1068
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,760
to talk more about that shortly. What

1069
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:01,440
are the domains that matter? How are we

1070
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,520
going to measure them? And how are we

1071
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,640
going to put them into clinical trials?

1072
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:08,720
This is so vitally important for us all

1073
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,640
to understand why clinical trials are

1074
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,920
complicated because we have to measure

1075
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,240
all of these things and we're going to

1076
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,640
talk a lot more about that tomorrow. But

1077
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,800
you have to understand why we have all

1078
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,880
of these assessments for our kids

1079
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,359
because we have to understand what can

1080
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,119
capture change.

1081
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:28,400
This isn't for you to read. It's for you

1082
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:30,559
to understand it's a lot of work. It's a

1083
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,599
lot of money. And this is where your

1084
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,200
dollars go to support these efforts for

1085
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:37,760
us to be able to get over the finish

1086
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,400
line for all of these amazing sponsors

1087
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,119
that are sitting in this room to do

1088
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,599
everything they can to help our kids and

1089
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,240
that's why we're here. And so that is

1090
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,240
just a testament to the commitment. So

1091
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,440
hopefully what you can see is that every

1092
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,160
platform that we're talking about may

1093
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,880
benefit different targets.

1094
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,960
Each modality may lead to different

1095
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:05,680
amounts of drug or UB3A in the brain in

1096
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,880
different places and that may all have a

1097
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,200
different clinical effect on our kids.

1098
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:13,359
Different families are going to have

1099
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,960
different preferences.

1100
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,520
Some people may be very uncomfortable

1101
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,119
with a single treatment gene therapy.

1102
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:21,440
Some may be very uncomfortable going

1103
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,359
under anesthesia every three months to

1104
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,880
get a lumbar puncture to have an ASO

1105
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,720
delivered.

1106
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,200
Some may only want an oral pill for

1107
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,040
their kids. And some may never want to

1108
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,599
enter a hospital and will only do a

1109
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:36,800
remote clinical trial because it is too

1110
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:39,520
much energy, effort, and challenge to

1111
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,079
get their children to be seen in a

1112
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,680
hospital in a clinical trial setting.

1113
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,839
So these are all things we have to think

1114
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,079
about as an organization to meet the

1115
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,480
needs of every one of you. And we work

1116
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,960
really hard to try to do that. And what

1117
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,880
we also don't know is what if

1118
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,079
combination therapy is the best therapy

1119
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,319
of all? What if we need an ASO with a

1120
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,400
gene therapy? What if we need a small

1121
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,200
molecule with an ASO or with a gene

1122
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,440
therapy? How are we going to know if we

1123
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,839
don't develop all of them and support

1124
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,559
those developing all of them? And that

1125
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,119
is our role because we do know the more

1126
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,520
options we have for our kids, the better

1127
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,319
chance of them having something that

1128
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,880
leads to a meaningful change in their

1129
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:25,200
lives and ours.

1130
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,280
So the standard drug development process

1131
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:30,960
looks like this.

1132
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:33,599
For every 15,000 drugs that are in early

1133
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,800
discovery, that are in a dish, that are

1134
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,960
in a mouse, that are in an organoid,

1135
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,599
one gets approved.

1136
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,160
What does that mean? We have to address

1137
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,760
all shots on goal. But what does that

1138
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,200
cost?

1139
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,520
3 to 10 years in pre-clinical, two to

1140
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,960
three years in all of the safety studies

1141
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:57,920
required by the FDA, 3 to five years for

1142
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,040
an earlyphase study, two to five years

1143
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,480
for late phase studies.

1144
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:09,440
Well, let's just do the math.

1145
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:11,760
That's a lot of money for one program.

1146
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,079
So what happens is that we wait for

1147
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,760
pharmaceutical companies who in our mind

1148
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,319
as parents have all the money in the

1149
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,800
world. Yes, you industry, we think you

1150
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,240
have all the money in the world to

1151
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:26,240
support the development of these

1152
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,480
programs. But guess what? They don't. So

1153
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,160
they have to make priorities. They have

1154
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,880
to think about what has the highest

1155
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,160
chance of success because we have to

1156
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,880
fund what we believe can be successful

1157
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,960
to maintain our pipeline. They can't

1158
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,760
take every shot on goal even though they

1159
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,720
might want to. So that leaves this area

1160
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,640
which we call the valley of death where

1161
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,920
we have a promising candidate in a mouse

1162
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:54,480
in a dish and we have to understand how

1163
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,720
it behaves in a human.

1164
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,240
That valley of death costs somewhere

1165
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,640
between 15 to$25 million per program.

1166
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:04,880
Who's going to pay for that?

1167
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,200
Industry might not.

1168
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,280
Yeah. So far, it's been you guys paying

1169
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:13,280
for that. So, thank you for filling this

1170
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,839
valley of death because it's the only

1171
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,359
way we can get drugs to patients.

1172
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:20,400
And what I want to share with you is

1173
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,839
that 10 years ago, and I know a lot of

1174
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,680
you that have been here for year after

1175
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,960
year wait for these slides because you

1176
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,520
want to see the progress that's being

1177
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,319
made. And it brings me more joy than you

1178
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:32,559
know to share these slides. 10 years

1179
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:34,240
ago, we had five programs in early

1180
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:37,200
development and not a single program in

1181
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:40,319
a clinical trial.

1182
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:42,319
Eight years ago, after we had our first

1183
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,200
large infusion of funds, thanks to the

1184
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:48,240
generosity of a single family,

1185
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:50,240
we had 15 programs,

1186
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:53,040
two in clinical trials, and multiple

1187
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:56,480
headed toward clinical trials.

1188
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,800
Four years ago, 34 programs, three in

1189
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,800
clinical trials, multiple headed toward

1190
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,280
clinical trials.

1191
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:07,280
And in 2022, the stock market crashed.

1192
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:11,599
Those

1193
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:13,520
34 programs went down to 24 programs.

1194
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:16,480
And that is the shoots and ladders of

1195
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:19,520
drug development. And it happens. And we

1196
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,359
had an awakening of the fact that we

1197
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:25,040
can't wait for everyone to do this for

1198
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:28,160
us because they might not.

1199
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,400
And when we lost 10 programs, it was

1200
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:32,640
devastating.

1201
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,359
But a year ago, we did not stop. We kept

1202
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:38,480
on going and we went from 24 to 27 last

1203
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,240
year. And where we are today is we have

1204
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,680
30 programs. A lot of these are

1205
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,599
undisclosed so they're not going to be

1206
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,000
on our website. Just I know Megan Edber

1207
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,440
is having a heart attack. They're not on

1208
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,599
our website. But I want you to

1209
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,400
understand how many people are working

1210
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:56,319
on Angelman Syndrome. Of those 30

1211
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,640
programs we have, count them. One, two,

1212
00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:02,240
three, four, five, six in clinical

1213
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:05,440
trials. our first gene therapy in a

1214
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:08,160
clinical trial.

1215
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,200
We have three in IND enabling studies,

1216
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,359
which means they're going to be in

1217
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,000
clinical trials. Hopefully, if those

1218
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:16,240
studies come out positive because they

1219
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,599
can still fail, they will go into

1220
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,880
clinical trials in the near term. And 16

1221
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,640
of those are being pushed by your

1222
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,400
dollars.

1223
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,119
That's important for everyone to

1224
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:33,119
recognize is that your dollars are going

1225
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:36,000
so far but it is not easy to get there.

1226
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:39,520
The the the pillar five is moving

1227
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:42,240
rapidly as well equally well and as we

1228
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:44,640
move forward we have a lot that we

1229
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,480
should be proud of. Numerous potential

1230
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:50,079
therapeutic platforms have been invested

1231
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:52,000
in as Angelman syndrome is unique with

1232
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:54,319
many many elegant gene targeted

1233
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,640
therapies and opportunities underway.

1234
00:54:54,319 --> 00:54:57,839
Promising clinical trial results we have

1235
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,720
seen to date which you're going to hear

1236
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:03,359
all about tomorrow. and fast has focused

1237
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,520
on identifying the scientific gaps to

1238
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,079
accelerate all potential strategies and

1239
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:10,559
support all shots on goal because we

1240
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,880
have no idea what the human experiment

1241
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,880
is going to show and we have to make

1242
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,240
sure that we find something for anybody

1243
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,079
who wants a therapy. Traditional drug

1244
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,040
development unfortunately has failed

1245
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,800
rare disease across the globe, not just

1246
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,760
Angelmen syndrome. And that's because

1247
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,079
money is drying up, investment is low,

1248
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,240
and companies have changing leadership,

1249
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,839
and they change their priorities. And

1250
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,319
sometimes those priority changes happen

1251
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:40,000
overnight. But we're not going to let it

1252
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:42,800
fail this one because FAST will continue

1253
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,720
to dream big because you guys asked us

1254
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,720
to.

1255
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,720
This is about parents and their dreams.

1256
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,119
So this is why fast decided to start the

1257
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:58,240
drug accelerator AS2 bio.

1258
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,960
And AS2 Bio is really meant to take

1259
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,359
venture philanthropy from patient

1260
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,160
advocacy and advance that into a

1261
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:09,599
disruptive accelerator. And that is the

1262
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,720
ecosystem of discovery in mice to

1263
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:16,079
discovery in human. And the only way we

1264
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:19,119
could do that is with this team. And

1265
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:22,799
there's so much that has gone into that

1266
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:24,319
through the support of the NIH and Yale

1267
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:26,000
University for the Crisper program,

1268
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:28,880
which you'll hear about tomorrow.

1269
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,799
Through the support of UCLA and Don

1270
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,880
Conn, who's here and being our keynote

1271
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,480
tomorrow, and SERM, the California

1272
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,160
Institute of Regenerative Medicine, who

1273
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,960
believes in this program and is

1274
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,799
advancing us to an IND

1275
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,040
through Maverick's bio. And I'd like to

1276
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,839
just acknowledge not only did our IND

1277
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:48,000
clear in April that everyone was really

1278
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:49,520
excited about, but yesterday it was

1279
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,520
announced that the first patient was

1280
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,520
dosed.

1281
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,480
And I would like to acknowledge a team

1282
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,599
that is sitting in this area that made

1283
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,240
that happen. The Mavericks team is here.

1284
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:08,640
Most of them, some of them are online.

1285
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,960
And none of that would be poss would be

1286
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:14,079
possible without this incredible team

1287
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,480
who believed we can help make a

1288
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,680
difference for Angelmen syndrome. And we

1289
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,640
don't know what's going to happen and we

1290
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,960
don't know where the data is going to

1291
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:23,520
go. But they never stopped believing and

1292
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,280
they worked their butt off to get us

1293
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:30,119
here. So I could not be more proud of

1294
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,119
that team at that table. So thank you.

1295
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,880
Ultrogenics has advanced the ASO program

1296
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,599
that we started and this was before the

1297
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,480
that AS2 was initiated and thanks to

1298
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,799
them we were able to do that. We are so

1299
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,520
proud of that collaboration and our

1300
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,640
collaboration with everybody Ionis and

1301
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,559
Oakill. We are so proud of incoded all

1302
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,960
of our programs. We don't help to stop

1303
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,839
stopping to support everybody. But it

1304
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,720
started with ultragenics and a dream.

1305
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:05,280
And that led to Mavericks, Courageous,

1306
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:08,079
Transformatics, and other programs that

1307
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,640
we're actively working on. So, something

1308
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:13,280
that's always important to remember is

1309
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:18,200
that it always seems impossible until

1310
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,200
it's done. Thank you.
