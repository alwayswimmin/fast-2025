1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,240
So, our last talk before the break is um

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,839
going to be from Ellen Cuks.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
That's hard and I tried to get it right.

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,080
Thank you. Um and Ellen has just been

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,039
such an incredible advocate and asset to

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,520
joining the FAST family. Um Ellen really

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
leads Fast Global and she's here to

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,840
share with you all of the

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,199
accomplishments of our global

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,119
affiliates. Um FAST is global. That's

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,279
just what it is. Angelman syndrome is

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,800
global and we need to be sure that we

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,559
represent everybody around the world

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,120
living with Angelman syndrome and the

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,960
efforts that have been undertaken by

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,440
various regions around the world is

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,680
tremendous and we can't underestimate

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,079
that and so many people have come here

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,000
from all over the world to listen to the

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,320
research of course much of it is being

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,200
done in the United States but it's being

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,280
done to help everybody around the world

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,760
not to stay in the United States and the

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,760
advocacy and the the work that's being

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,600
done by all of these affiliates should

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,280
not be should not go unnoticed and

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,680
certainly needs to be highlighted,

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,199
represented, and cheered for. So, Ellen

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,880
is going to share with you some of the

30
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
amazing accomplishments of each of the

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
affiliates, and I'm really excited to

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,920
hear all of the work to come to fruition

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,920
year after year. Ellen,

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,439
>> good afternoon everyone. For those who

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,280
do not know me yet, my name is Alan Kuks

36
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,720
and I serve as a global adviser for

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,560
fast. I'm also the proud mother of Hazel

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
who lives with Angelman syndrome and

39
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
it's through her that I became part of

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,560
this incredible community. Now for

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
almost two years now, I had the

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
privilege of working closely together

43
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,399
with our fast global affiliates and I

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,320
must say their passion and their

45
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,920
dedication to improving the lives of

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,079
individuals living with Angelman

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,880
syndrome and their families is truly

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,360
inspiring. They are truly the heart and

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,520
the hands of fast around the world,

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,640
raising awareness, supporting families,

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,960
but also helping to accelerate research.

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,560
Now, in the next video, you'll hear from

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,119
the global affiliates as they share

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,200
their highlights of 2025,

55
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,040
but also their ambitions for 2026.

56
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,360
Before we start the video, I would like

57
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
to ask all our global affiliate

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,599
representatives who are here with us

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,680
today to please stand up so we can

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,879
recognize you and thank you for

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,920
everything that you do for our

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,920
community. Please stand up so we can see

63
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,920
you.

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
It's been an absolute honor to

65
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,480
collaborate with this inspiring group of

66
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,720
people and I couldn't be more proud to

67
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,959
introduce their work to you today.

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,319
>> I don't know if we can start the video

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,319
or I should start.

70
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,280
>> Hi, my name is Shane and I'm the

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,360
chairperson of Fast Australia. 2025 has

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,239
been a big year for us in Australia.

73
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,000
This year we had Mitch run an incredible

74
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,159
1100 km in 27 days for Huxley's Heroes.

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,319
That's a marathon a day running from

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,959
Broken Hill to Newcastle in New South

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
Wales. Mitch captivated the whole of

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,400
Australia with his running feet, raising

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,360
awareness for AS and raising $160,000

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,040
for Fast Australia. We also held our

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,040
bianual collaborative conference in

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,319
Sydney with the Australian partner

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,799
organization ASA. Day one was dedicated

84
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,560
to science with day two dedicated to

85
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,360
educating our AS parents on the

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,120
day-to-day living with AS. We rounded

87
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,720
out the weekend with a gala ball where

88
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,959
we raised just over $180,000.

89
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,959
So, what does 2026 bring for us in

90
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
Australia? Like the rest of the world,

91
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,599
we're really looking forward to hosting

92
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,680
some phase 3 clinical trials. We will

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,159
continue to build on our AS clinic

94
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,400
program, funding clinical nurses in

95
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,799
Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. It's an

96
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,760
important program giving our families

97
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,159
access to our wonderful AS medical

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
experts whenever they need it. And

99
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,879
finally, look out for the Global

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,519
Angelment Syndrome Registry 2.0 in the

101
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,280
early part of 2026. It's fair to say

102
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
we've had some challenges with GASA this

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,919
year, but we're really looking forward

104
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,880
to releasing 2.0 in 2026.

105
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,759
>> Hello everybody. I'm Charlotte Pa. I'm

106
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,520
the vice president of Faster France. The

107
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,000
two points we would like to highlight

108
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,960
this year. Uh the first one is the

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,600
mapping of the French community. We have

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,360
built a map of the French community with

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,600
nearly 200 rest families.

112
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,919
This bus helps investigator sites

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,479
recruit patient more easily and more

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,440
quickly while showcasing our community

115
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,639
to farmers. The two leverage business

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,440
intelligence making it an easy

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,880
interactive tool to filter the map by

118
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,960
age, genotypes and regions.

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,199
This forex is thus being replicated

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,000
within several countries around the

121
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,479
world to bring the global AS community

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,440
in focus.

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,919
Second topic we would like to highlight

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,199
is that we have launched successfully

125
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,759
the very first research project funded

126
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,320
by fast friends. This is a study to

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,600
assess whether eye trackking can serve

128
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,479
as a robust tool to measure a champions

129
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,280
social perception challenges simply by

130
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,400
capturing eye position while watching

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,600
the videos. The study is underway with

132
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,600
around 20 children already enrolled and

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,680
we hope to share results with you next

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,120
year.

135
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,199
26 still like some kind of ambition plan

136
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,479
as we have identified two research

137
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,320
projects. One on the toe protein

138
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,639
assessing whether it could serve as a

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,440
biomarket in the context of ongoing

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,639
experimental treatment and the second

141
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
one on e- health using connected tools

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
to measure all children's sleep

143
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,319
difficulties at home. So a lot of

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,600
projects and hopes for below one. Thank

145
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:15,360
you. Hello everyone. My name is Tom Kio

146
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,440
and I'm the chairman of Fast UK. 2025

147
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,280
has been a great year for us. We have

148
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,360
continued our campaign to engage further

149
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,680
with the community which is also one of

150
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
our greatest challenges. As well as

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
this, we continue to fund the natural

152
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,160
history study in Oxford which has now

153
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,720
been extended for another two years. The

154
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,560
study and its finding findings have been

155
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,440
instrumental to bringing clinical trials

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,479
into the UK. A few highlights of what

157
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,479
Fast UK have achieved this year include

158
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,560
our annual event at Alton Towers over

159
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,960
international arrangement day which Fast

160
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
UK sponsor and which gathers families to

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,360
get together. It highlights FAST as a

162
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
charity and therefore raises awareness

163
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
and support from AS families and their

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,560
friends with many then fundraising for

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,120
us. Due to this success, the numbers

166
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,800
increase year on year. We ran a media

167
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,800
campaign across national radio,

168
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,039
newspapers and TV coverage over

169
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,919
international Angelment Day in February

170
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,240
and International Carers Week in June.

171
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,720
We launched a successful caregivers

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,919
survey obtaining key information as well

173
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,080
as reaching out into the community.

174
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,599
We strive and continue to make closer

175
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
connections with other rare disease

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:29,199
communities and the Genetic Alliance UK,

177
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,120
which we continue to into 2026 as well.

178
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,440
We are involved in key discussions about

179
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
the expansion of newborn earlier

180
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,360
screening prayers and again we'll

181
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,080
continue this into next year. We

182
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,800
welcomed a new trustee this year Sarah

183
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,280
Washbrook who has been instrumental in

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,599
being involved in one reform of the law

185
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,240

fast UK's voice.

190
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
for 2026. As well as that mentioned

191
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,039
before, we will also continue to push

192
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,360
hard to engage the community as

193
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,440
treatments get ever closer to get to

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,520
know and support farmer companies as we

195
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
step towards regulatory approval as well

196
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,360
as continuing to engage within

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,360
regulatory bodies.

198
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,840
>> Hello everyone, my name is Benedetto and

199
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,199
I am a board member at Fast Italy. In

200
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,840
2025, Fast Italy moved from the legal

201
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,800
form of a charity association to the

202
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,760
legal form of a foundation, which gave

203
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,880
us a higher consideration and

204
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,760
recognition from the government and from

205
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:47,040
hospitals. In 2025, we also organized

206
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,399
the very first Italy scientific

207
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,360
conference. The event gave us the

208
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:56,720
opportunity together with the Angelman

209
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,839
community and to reach new families.

210
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,240
Also, since the event was highlighted in

211
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,600
some national newspapers,

212
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,160
we reached the goal to increase

213
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,200
awareness. I want to take the

214
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,800
opportunity to thank you again all the

215
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:18,000
speakers who came to Italy. Some of them

216
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,800
are in this room right now and I want to

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,160
tell you that this were really

218
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,480
appreciated by the whole community and

219
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:32,040
it was really important for us to have

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,040
you there in person. Thank you again.

221
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,120
>> Hi there. My name is Noah Firestone and

222
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,480
I'm the chair of Fast Canada.

223
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,040
The achievements that we're most proud

224
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,200
of in 2025 would be our community

225
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,440
organized fundraisers of which we've had

226
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,959
great success and as well we're just

227
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
coming to the end of our second year of

228
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,120
funding to the University of North

229
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,760
Carolina Dr. Kung's lab for human

230
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,560
derived stem cell models. The impact of

231
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,240
our achievements are great and it's the

232
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
reason that we chose this funding in the

233
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
first place and that was to support the

234
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,839
entire research ecosystem as a whole for

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
bringing treatments to Angelman syndrome

236
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,440
and that is that with these human

237
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,200
derived stem cell models all researchers

238
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,240
that have an avenue towards treatments

239
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,120
are able to apply it to this

240
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,360
in 2026. We do have some goals and that

241
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,240
is to have Canada do their part and join

242
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,640
in on providing data to clinicians and

243
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,920
to throughout the world. So, we are in

244
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,600
the starting steps of developing a

245
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,680
caregiver survey as well as developing a

246
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,440
program to promote and to locate

247
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,399
clinicians and physicians throughout

248
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
Canada to educate them about Angelmen

249
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
syndrome and about patients with Zelman

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,040
syndrome so that they're best able to

251
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,200
direct their patients for best

252
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,160
practices.

253
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,399
>> Hola, I am Cesario Guyana Duran with the

254
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,560
scientific committee of PAS Spain. This

255
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,880
year has been a very good year for

256
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,440
Angelman syndrome research. We gave a

257
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,120
big push to research in Spain. First, uh

258
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,120
we added a molecular lab from the

259
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
government for the first time. Second,

260
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,240
we managed to get two private

261
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,800
universities in one single project that

262
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,399
has now be joined by three Italian

263
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,920
leading institutions in the field of

264
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,480
rare diseases. Third, uh we launched our

265
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,480
second grant with a hund,000 euros

266
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,320
endowment for the winner. got all these

267
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,160
things talking to each other and start

268
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,839
collaborating as well. Our second

269
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,839
biggest achievement was in terms of

270
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,720
fundraising. Just in the first half of

271
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,279
the year, families raised over 35,000.

272
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,079
Family organized events. Also, for the

273
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,000
first time, we started participating in

274
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,000
corporate social responsibility grants

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
by private companies and we won our

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,600
first one and we are going for two more.

277
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,320
Maybe at the end of the year, we will

278
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,200
have more results on that. For 2026, we

279
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,839
plan to have at least uh three active

280
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,920
projects at national history study, the

281
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,399
one on the teeth and the biomarkers and

282
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,279
maybe at a fourth one. In terms of uh

283
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,200
fundraiser, we hope to get an record

284
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,560
year in fundraising by incorporating

285
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,399
more grants from the corporate sector.

286

>> My name is Sarah Gayy and I'm a board

287
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,120
member of Fast Germany. We at Fast

288
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,360
Germany look back on 2025 with deep

289
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,760
gratitude. Thanks to support of our

290
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,600
community and dedicated celebrities, we

291
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,160
were able to raise 131,381

292
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,079
euros through our fundraising campaign.

293
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,480
With these funds, we've been able to

294
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,480
secure financial support for three

295
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,360
Angelmen clinics in Germany for another

296
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,040
five years. This enables our doctors on

297
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,000
site to conduct their own Angelmen

298
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,680
research, a valuable step that helps

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,959
strengthen the angel research in

300
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,200
Germany. We are also proud that Germany

301
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,200
is now actively involved in several

302
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,839
clinical trials focused on angelman

303
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,320
syndrome. Each of these studies brings

304
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,320
us closer to our shared vision to one

305
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,519
day find an effective treatment for our

306
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,160
loved ones. On behalf of Fast Germany,

307
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,440
we say thank you for your trust, your

308
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,440
generosity, and your hope. Together,

309

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,600
chairperson of fast pol. This year was

313
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,360
breakthrough for our Polish community.

314
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
For the first time in the history,

315
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,079
clinical trials of a potential therapy

316
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,240
for Angeloman syndrome has started also

317
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,320
in Poland. Thanks to strong

318
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,200
collaboration with medical experts,

319
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,440
industry partners and our community,

320
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,480
Polish families can now actively take

321
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,480
part in this global research.

322
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,880
Fast Poland together with medical

323
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,880
university of Bosnan launched the first

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,079
national cost of living with Angela

325
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,200
syndrome study. It shows a real as

326
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,480
burden for families, caregivers, health

327
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,360
care system and society. It will will be

328
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,000
a powerful tool to advocate for access

329
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
once therapy is approved.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,880
We celebrate International and Syndrome

331
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,680
Day with a conference between dreams and

332
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,399
reality. It brought together medical

333
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,320
experts, parent and therapist to share

334
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:10,560
knowledge and hope. In 2026, we will

335
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,760
continue to advocate for our community

336
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,680
and raise awareness so that no family

337
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,240
has to face Angelman syndrome alone.

Hi, my name is Stephanie Azut. I am the

339
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,680
president of Fastlatam and I'm the

340
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,480
mother of Michelle who lives with

341
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,279
Angelman Syndrome. 2025 has been a year

342
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,600
of important achievements for Fastlam.

343
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,760
We have successfully completed the data

344
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,480
analysis for our cross-sectional patient

345
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,560
study which included 90 patients in

346
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,279
three different countries. This has

347
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,279
given given us valuable insights into

348
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,920
the clinical characteristics of Angelmen

349
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,639
syndrome across the region. Also, in

350
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,440
collaboration with FastT Poland and Fast

351
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,760
France, our caregiver impact survey has

352
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,079
become a very powerful tool to better

353
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,519
understand the perspectives of families

354
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:02,720
and the unmet needs they face every day.

355
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,560
Looking ahead, 2026 will be a very

356
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
important year for us. We are thrilled

357
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,639
to announce our second Latin American

358
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,440
Angelman Syndrome Conference, which will

359
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,920
take place in Mexico City on April 30th

360
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,920
and May 1st. This event once again will

361
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,639
bring together families, researchers,

362
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,880
clinicians, and industry to accelerate

363
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,880
progress across the region. Everyone is

364
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
invited and we hope to see you there.

365
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,000
Beyond the conference, we'll also

366
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,079
continue building community through

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,720
international Angelman Day activities,

368
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,600
