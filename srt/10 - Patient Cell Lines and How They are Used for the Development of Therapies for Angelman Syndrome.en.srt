1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm very happy to introduce our next

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,520
speaker who is Dr. Yang Wee Jiang who

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,160
most of you know and I don't think he

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,519
needs an introduction. Um he happens to

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,639
be one of my favorite people on the

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,200
planet and also somebody who believes

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,199
deeply in this community. Um from

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,640
everything from creating the tools,

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,720
testing them from in vitro to invivo and

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,240
actually moving that from the bench to

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,800
the bedside. And so you're going to hear

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,720
a lot from him and his team um today

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,960
with in vitro and then the following

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,040
talk is someone Jeanoo from his team

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,559
talking about in in vivo. But then

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,239
tomorrow you're going to hear about the

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,719
translation of that to human clinical

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
trials. So um very exciting and very

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
happy to have him here. He's going to

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
talk to us about what those cell lines

21
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,200
in a dish look like for Angelman

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,200
syndrome. So Young Way

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,079
Well, thank you Allison and good to see

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,120
everyone every year this time too. Um

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,640
I'm extremely impressed by Ryan's um

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,000
talk and Allison remind me I'm talking

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,880
to most of you are parents uh multiple

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,439
times once you understand my science

29
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,840
then you can go to DC and request more

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,000
money for the research back to the Yale.

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,759
So you are much much much more powerful

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,080
voice than we do as a scientist.

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,720
Government say okay you always want

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,640
money but no impact. Um can my my slide

35
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,079
up.

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,560
Oh okay. Um

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:44,640
so I already yeah go that's fine. Why go

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,640
back? Oh that's first one. Oh okay. So

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,320
Allison give me this title. um try to go

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,960
over the some of the work we have done

41
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,399
in the lab with the fast support over

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,240
last four or five years. Um from this

43
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,840
morning's talk you probably already

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
learn

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,160
animal model like mice it's pretty

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,879
valuable. Um that's we as many of you

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,599
know me that I created the first and

48
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:17,280
mouse model when I was in Dr. last lab

49
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,760
as student but again it's a additional

50
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,040
model we created last couple years and

51
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,879
this one with larger delion the original

52
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,760
one is a good one but there a one we're

53
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,959
going to see here later after my talk

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,120
probably is an even better mouse model.

55
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,120
uh the reason we can use the mouse model

56
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,319
is there's a lot of syn between human

57
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,599
and mice we call conserve which is

58
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,959
similar particular at a concept level or

59
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,519
mechanis level however if we go into the

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,400
microscope like ultra structure getting

61
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,040
the we call the DNA sequence human and

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
mice are different so that's what this

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,000
morning you heard the talk mice is not

64
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,040
human that's a limitation using the

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,920
animal model but how do you do it in the

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,640
human particular form you do need a

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,519
human neuron. So that's the technology

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,920
common particular for example if

69
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,959
anti-sense oliggo many of you familiar

70
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,760
with was testing the animal it's not

71
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,519
directly translatable to the human

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
because human and the mice for the

73
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,560
anti-sense oliggo that stretched DNA

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,080
sequence is a completely different so

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,920
everything you learn from the mouse

76
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,680
model you have to be retested that

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,480
redesign and before you go to the human

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,720
so overcoming the limitation for animal

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,319
model we need a human neuron the

80
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,080
technology mentioned early in the

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,680
morning too called IPSC it's a short

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,239
abbreviation for in the poly potent stem

83
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,159
cell which you clearly see the

84
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,560
difference between human and mice it's

85
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,400
the human brain is a thousand time

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,200
bigger than mouse and even

87
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:07,360
mouse is still invivo we call invivo

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:10,400
model live model so since 2020 21 uh in

89
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,200
the middle of co Alice and I had a

90
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,680
discussion so we start this project so

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,280
yes we we need to build up a bio

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,639
repository with all the different

93
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,840
patient different genotype so that's

94
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,800
what I show here so we're happy to say

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,600
um we completed this project every

96
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,520
individual genotype hope everyone here

97
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,800
the family here we all have the IPSC

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,919
created at the Yale stem center and we

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,120
also created some of control as for this

100
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,880
experiment and again thank you a lot of

101
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,919
you here fast support or individuals

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,560
listed here on the last genotype many of

103
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,639
you contribute you remember it's a

104
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,880
middle of a co I had a conversation the

105
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,680
zone meeting with you and eventually we

106
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,240
work out how to do it and during the co

107
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,919
time so just walk through a few key step

108
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,280
once uh we get blood from your kids and

109
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,080
then how it was worked out at Yale. It's

110
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,039
a pretty complicated process and a long

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,680
duration too. Remember I talked to you

112
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,400
and goes through this we call RB

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,600
requirement explain to you the protocol

114
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,080
and what will we do and at Yale and make

115
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,080
sure you understand everything we do.

116
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,919
Then you say yes, I will contribute.

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Then you put your signature on the paper

118
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,560
and then you mail back to us. Then we

119
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,199
arrang into the blood collection during

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,160
the co time. Thank you a lot of your

121
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,479
local physician pediatrician support. So

122
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,400
we're able to do this. So we collect a

123
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,919
blood then we will um do the sort of

124
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,520
spin down and that time we're going to

125
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,000
testing a lot of things like a

126
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,720
micropplasma hepatitis B hepatitis C and

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,440
during the covid time we also testing co

128
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,080
for the sample we collected then we use

129
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,360
the term called reprogramming basically

130
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,680
we collect a sample from blood by the

131
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,560
special technology called reprogramming

132
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,840
return to the blood cell we call adult

133
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,560
cell all the old cell converting to the

134
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,280
baby cell called a stem cell. So that

135
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,919
term called reprogramming it's a

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,400
technology developed by the Japanese

137
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,039
scientist which got a Nobel Prize for

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
about 15 years ago. So with that

139
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,840
technology then we generate using kind

140
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
of reprogramming and a lot of magic

141
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,280
process in the picture dish. Then we say

142
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,960
hey um indeed we can turn to the blood

143
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,120
cell to the baby cell kind of stem cell.

144
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
After that when we make sure when we do

145
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
the reprogramming

146
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,080
everything still maintain the good

147
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,800
quality. So we have do lot of the we

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,520
callization look at the genotype then

149
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,680
eventually this cell was preserved then

150
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,400
we can shipping out to many many

151
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,960
investigator in the in the world. So

152
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,240
that here's a step we took and we were

153
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,599
going to first confirm the genotype of

154
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,280
Anderman still maintain and in addition

155
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,599
as no other sort of genetic

156
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,360
alteration due to the reprogramming

157
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,919
mistake happened it's now no longer end

158
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,639
plus something that's not good. We also

159
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,759
did all other work together confirm

160
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,960
every cell is good and that's ready to

161
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,800
go and also we must make sure this cell

162
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,080
after called reprogramming they indeed

163
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,000
could poly potent which is stem cell we

164
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,319
use a different marker beautiful looking

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,720
for individual marker say okay cell

166
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,919
looking good and also we were going to

167
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,800
transfer the cell to the life mice which

168
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,080
is immune deficiency mice make sure this

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,400
cell indeed as a capability to

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,960
differential or turn into many different

171
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,720
type of cell like a neuron and muscle

172
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:10,160
and other called a terteratoma assay. So

173
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,479
after that one we keep in the storage

174
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,039
then we make many expanded many many

175
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,360
clone and many vials. So anyone come

176
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,680
from any institution interested we say

177
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,440
okay yeah we have it we shipping to you

178
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,919
in next day so eventually and fast Alice

179
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,479
and other we work out say okay this is a

180
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,800
resource would be good for community in

181
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,919
the long term we got to re make this one

182
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
public so we finally made this ebisic

183
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,360
repository so everyone in the world

184
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,719
commercial entity farmer and uh

185
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,760
investigating in the academic

186
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,000
institution they can free access to so

187
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,000
Happy to say uh we already distributed

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,360
many many PI and a few company. Uh happy

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,600
also to say there are two paper using

190
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,480
this cell line. It's under review right

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,000
now. So very soon you will see this uh

192
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,640
product in the community.

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
So um

194
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,440
once we do this I'm going to show you a

195
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,760
few case what we do how to use the cell

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
line to develop a treatment or testing

197
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,920
treatment. So once once you get a

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,040
disease and then you say okay um what do

199
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,040
we do one thing for sure the purpose is

200
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,279
we can we need to generate a human

201
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,000
neuron. So that's two technology we

202
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,920
using one we call 2D neuron basically

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,640
peach dish you can see individual neuron

204
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,800
in a peach dish second we call organal

205
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,519
you heard this morning we call 3D neuron

206
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,600
sometime which basically it's a mini

207
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,560
brain it's a much more complex than 2D

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,200
it's a 3D threedimension look like the

209
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,600
human brain of course it's a mini size

210
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,080
it's not perfect but it's the best we

211
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,279
can do right now

212
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,399
um so we can use have first testing for

213
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,040
example testing for new treatment. This

214
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,519
one we're working on on as you know we

215
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,720
do this called gene editing using a new

216
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,120
technology not viral non nanop particle.

217
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,480
So we can use this cell screen many many

218
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,480
different guard here we can testing 20

219
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,279
which you can see each guard is

220
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,000
different efficiency then the pink the

221
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
highest one tells you the best one. So

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,120
that's the first thing you can do very

223
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,279
easily can do in a couple weeks time and

224
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,640
we also show beautiful you can see this

225
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:32,000
green signal shows you indeed you knock

226
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,880
out anti- sense and reactivate the sense

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,720
the UB3 the green signal is very very

228
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,360
efficient and that's another way to look

229
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,000
at this result then furthermore we

230
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,040
create organal which you can see this is

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
three dimension structure so you choose

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,000
a very complex mimicking the human brain

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,360
structure with different color shows you

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,079
different type of cell and it also shows

235
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,360
you most interesting for part of you

236
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,480
focus on the green signal it's a UBCA we

237
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,720
attached to the UBCA gene with EGFP

238
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,680
green form proteins you can see after

239
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,079
incubator this green organal or 3D

240
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,200
neuron you see the green signal shows

241
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,040
you reactivation happening editing it's

242
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,360
working.

243
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,240
So with that also you can see this

244
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,760
particular one as we engineer with the

245
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:31,120
human neuron. So we put the EGFP touch

246
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,600
to the enderman UPCA gene. So you treat

247
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,560
with a crisp editing you can see the

248
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,800
reactivation happen. So when Alice and I

249
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,000
look at this data she said okay this is

250
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,320
perfect for precision medicine. As many

251
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,760
of parents probably know you talking

252
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,200
each other say hey my kids have a delion

253
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,680
your kids have delion so my kids is not

254
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,200
same as your kid the same thing for the

255
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,640
UBC mutation so that come down to the

256
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,600
heterogeneity or complexity but ideal

257
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,360
way in ideal way you would say okay

258
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,240
before you get a trim everyone should

259
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
get a cell and we testing first and see

260
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,399
whether it's efficient for this one. So

261
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,800
this is a beautiful example. You can see

262
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,360
this cell is a patient with larger

263
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,839
deletion. We treated with a crisp

264
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,320
editing. You can see the reactivation

265
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,360
happen. It's quite efficient. Of course,

266
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,000
it's not 100% but it's pretty efficient

267
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:32,079
way as Allison talking earlier. If you

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,480
have a 20% versus 40% or five 10%. So

269
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,399
that's the future. Of course, we have no

270
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,880
resource. We're not able to generate

271
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,760
cell line for every one of you but we

272
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,399
will use this as a showcase indeed the

273
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,200
value of this cell line would generate

274
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,680
for future for develop additional new

275
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
treatment with that I'm going to

276
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,320
summarize

277
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,360
indeed with the fast support many of

278
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,720
your contribution and also particular

279
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,399
for many family and contributed blood

280
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,760
and that we were able to generate 15 and

281
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,920
cell line from all different genotype

282
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,800
UPD delion po mutation imprint mutation

283
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,279
all cover for that case everyone

284
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,839
particular investigate interesting study

285
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,320
this one you can just send email to me

286
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,880
or go to ebisk they are free to

287
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,079
distribute uh for this particular this

288
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,600
all we generated we're free it's a free

289
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,600
distribution that's one condition

290
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,800
Allison very clear when we talk this

291
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,920
project make sure y allow allow this

292
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,560
free distribution for everyone including

293
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,320
farmer for the cell line we generated we

294
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,639
achieve that goal for the purpose um for

295
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,920
sure we show you the case that indeed

296
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,399
it's valuable for the human neuron

297
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,279
different from the mice but it's a human

298
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,680
neuron which often time eventually is

299
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,720
needed to move into the human drug

300
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,120
product for all different reason so this

301
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,240
cell line indeed I think it's extremely

302
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,880
valuable for engine community often time

303
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,519
is also valuable for other community

304
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,760
they can come to us as we call they call

305
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,760
okay can we have engine cell as a

306
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,480
country yeah perfectly yeah we will give

307
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,639
to you to help your community for the

308
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,120
research

309
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,120
for sure uh this project we're now

310
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,040
getting started with the fast without

311
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,800
fast support and a lot of people

312
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,920
contribute Allison and

313
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,040
um other from board member and all the

314
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,519
family contribute this repository. The

315
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,839
people in my lab and Shaa are

316
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:45,199
particularly contributed for this

317
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,680
project. With that stop here, thank you

318
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,680
for the opportunity.

319
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
Thank you, Young Way. That that was

320
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,480
great. And hopefully everyone realizes

321
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,000
the power of your kids blood did that.

322
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
And that is how drugs are being

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,320
developed is based off of the blood of

324
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
your children that have become neurons.

325
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,079
Um, so that's incredibly important and

326
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,480
thank you for everyone who committed and

327
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,480
donated cells for this initiative that

328
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,720
is helping all industry members

329
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
ultimately.
