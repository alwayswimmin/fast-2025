1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,359
So now the next talk is going to be

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,080
great because now that you understand

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,320
what UB3A does, you can understand why

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,880
we want to replace it. And we're gonna

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,119
have a talk by um by our next speaker

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,520
here. Hold on. I had a Oh, by Dr. Emma

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,359
James. She's from Encoded Therapeutics.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,119
And she's not here representing Encoded.

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,760
She's actually here because I heard her

10
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,359
speak about gene therapy appearance at

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
another conference that I was speaking

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,160
at and she just broke it down in such a

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,000
way that was so incredibly digestible

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,079
that I felt it was really important that

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,920
you all heard that because as you all

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,440
know gene therapy is a reality for

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,840
Angelmen syndrome today and we'll talk

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,000
more about that later today as well as a

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,399
ton about that tomorrow. Um but I want

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,960
Emma to be able to explain to you what

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,039
it means and how it works. So, Emma, if

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,760
you wouldn't mind, please take it away.

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,760
Make this very digestible.

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,719
[Applause]

25
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,479
>> Good morning, everyone. If any of you

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,640
see me talking more than once, you'll

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,720
see I always carry my uh bottle of water

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,439
around because I get crazy dry mouth

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,840
standing in front of you all. Um but

30
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,159
anyway, I would uh firstly like to thank

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,720
Allison and the meeting organizers um

32
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
for inviting me here to present today.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
Uh my name is Emma James. I work for

34
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,079
Encoded. Um Encoded is a gene therapy

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,520
company developing um gene therapies for

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,520
uh neurological disorders.

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,600
Um

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,400
my disclosures I would coded. So as

39
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,159
you've already heard today, we've come a

40
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,240
long way in medicine. You know, we've

41
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,880
come from being able to develop

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,799
antibiotics to developing vaccines that

43
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,720
can save lives. And now we're really

44
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,000
entering a new phase uh of medicine with

45
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,079
treatment modalities that can go beyond

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,680
managing the symptoms to addressing the

47
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,319
whole range of um signs and symptoms uh

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,120
of certain genetic diseases. And it's at

49
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,720
its simplest the idea of gene therapy is

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
that you take a cell with a

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
non-functioning gene you add genetic

52
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,480
material and that leads to the cell

53
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,959
functioning normally.

54
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,840
So I'm going to use an analogy here. So

55
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,959
just like factories rely on detailed

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,599
manuals to produce products, cells rely

57
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,519
on DNA. And the DNA contains the

58
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,640
instructions. Think of it like

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,680
blueprints for building the tools our

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,800
bodies need to function. So here we have

61
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,920
the factory and the factory has manuals

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,480
and the manual contains uh individual

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,040
blueprints for individual products. A

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,879
light bulb, a telephone, security

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,760
camera.

66
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,480
Our cells are the factories. Our genome

67
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,680
which is made of DNA is the is the

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,640
factory manual and the individual genes

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,760
that comprise our our genome are the

70
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,680
individual instructions for individual

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,680
products which in the case of people are

72
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,680
proteins.

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
So the instructions inside this

74
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,440
blueprint are really complex and so the

75
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,840
factory has a process to simplify them.

76
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,400
So the factory here it's a light bulb

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,720
factory and it copies or transcribes

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,680
the relevant sections

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,680
into a clear stepby-step set of

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
instructions. Think of it like an

81
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,840
assembly guide and then the workers can

82
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,159
take that assembly guide and turn that

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,720
into the product. So in the factory it's

84
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,120
a light bulb in the for people it's the

85
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,080
protein.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
So our cells work in the same way. So

87
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
first they transcribe the information in

88
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,360
the DNA of our genes and then they turn

89
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,360
that into a simpler form the assembly

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,319
guide that's called messenger RNA.

91
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,560
That messenger RNA is then this clear

92
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,480
set of instructions that is then

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,480
translated into a protein.

94
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,160
So

95
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,120
each cell contains lots and lots of sets

96
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,840
of instructions,

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,800
but it only chooses the sets of

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,400
instructions from uh that that it needs

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,520
based off the information it's getting

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,360
from the environment. So each factory is

101
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,919
responsible for specific products. So

102
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,639
here our factory makes only light bulbs.

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,360
It has all the blueprints for all the

104
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,919
different products, but it switches off

105
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
the blueprints for the telephone and the

106
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,360
security camera, and it focuses on the

107
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,240
blueprints for the light bulb.

108
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,479
And our cells work in in much the same

109
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,800
way. despite having this the range of um

110
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,280
of all the different genes in nearly all

111
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
the cells of the body,

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,000
they choose based off the signals that

113
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,639
they're getting which genes they're

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,960
going to switch on. So in this way a

115
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,680
brain cell will switch on the genes to

116
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,240
enable it to produce say an iron channel

117
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,759
or a neurotransmitter and it will switch

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,600
off the uh the the controls to that

119
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,160
would enable it to become a muscle cell

120
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,479
say measin.

121
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:38,160
Similarly, a muscle cell will switch on

122
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,039
the genes to enable it to be a a myasy

123
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,360
and it will switch off the genes that

124
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,360
enable it to be to produce iron channels

125
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,479
and neurotransmitters.

126
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,639
And so this is the way that um the cells

127
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,360
essentially are able to produce

128
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,400
differential gene expression based off

129
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,240
what that gene what that cell needs to

130
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:03,440
be and what it needs to produce.

131
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,000
So, how does a cell know um and control

132
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,680
which which genes it needs to be

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
producing?

134
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,759
Well, each gene has special tags that

135
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,960
mark qu clearly where the instructions

136
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,039
begin. And these regulatory elements are

137
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,479
essentially binding sites throughout the

138
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,000
DNA that help regulate both where and

139
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,000
when the the genes are expressed.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,039
So firstly you have something called a

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,840
promoter which is a site in the DNA that

142
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,039
regulates where the cell initiates

143
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,840
transcription of a gene.

144
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,400
And then near the promoters we have

145
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,000
sites for things called transcription

146
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,720
factors. And these uh transcription

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,280
factors are DNA binding proteins that

148
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,080
help the cell uh regulate when or how

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,479
much of the gene is expressed. These

150
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
transcription factors can be positive or

151
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,960
they can or negative. So they can

152
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:06,000
upregulate or downregulate. And they are

153
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,120
cell specific again enabling a cell to

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,520
deter to to control what kind of cell it

155
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,520
wants to be.

156
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,360
So the promoter and the transcription

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:23,120
factors work um work together as a

158
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,919
complex on off but button to regulate

159
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,919
gene transcription um in in a very tight

160
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,639
manner and they can be very very highly

161
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,639
specific to a cell.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,039
So the regulation of the gene or the

163
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:42,960
gene activity can happen both at the DNA

164
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,960
level. So DNA being transcribed into

165
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,560
messenger RNA which is that assembly

166
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,039
guide or the regulation can happen at

167
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,240
the translational level which is where

168
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,240
where the messenger RNA is copied into a

169
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
protein.

170
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,400
So now we're going to talk a little bit

171
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,440
about gene therapy.

172
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,960
So, think of gene therapy as a delivery

173
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,560
vehicle that goes into the factory with

174
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,560
a new set of instructions to replace or

175
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,879
change the blueprints that the factories

176
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,879
using. So, gene therapy can be used to

177
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,520
manipulate the gene expression and

178
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,160
control the activity of the protein. It

179
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,960
can work at the transcriptional level.

180
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,080
So it can affect the DNA or it can work

181
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,399
at the translational level u by

182
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,360
affecting the messenger RNA. But the

183
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,959
outcome is that you influence the

184
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,959
protein that is ultimately produced.

185
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,320
Gene therapy is an umbrella term for

186
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,680
multiple ways to manipulate how cells

187
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
work.

188
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,800
Typically, when people think about gene

189
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,760
therapy, they're thinking about when DNA

190
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,800
is delivered to the cell via via a

191
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,000
single administration therapy. Um, and

192
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,760
and we this could be gene addition, it

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
could be gene silencing, it could be

194
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,640
gene editing. And I'll come back to that

195
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,720
in in a few slides time.

196
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,320
According to the American Society for

197
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,680
Cell and Gene Therapy, which describes

198
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,760
gene therapy as the use of genetic

199
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,839
material or the delivery of genetic

200
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,600
material to um to prevent or treat

201
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,839
disease. RNA therapy would also uh fall

202
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,399
under this category.

203
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,519
RNA therapy uses shorter sequences of

204
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,240
RNA to adjust how proteins are made. um

205
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,839
but typically it's requires repeated

206
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,959
dosing.

207
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,920
Examples are anti-sensor loanucleotides,

208
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,680
microRNAs, small interfering RNAs and

209
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,600
vaccines.

210
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,519
What's a little bit more complex in

211
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,080
terms of how we need to think about it

212
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,839
here is while um while you know these

213
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,560
microRNAs

214
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,959
here fall into RNA therapy there is

215
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,720
there are now methods in development

216
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:10,240
where uh gene therapy is used to deliver

217
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,720
the DNA that that uh provides

218
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,360
instructions for the body to make

219
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,519
microRNAs and small and small

220
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,160
interfering RNAs etc. So it's it it can

221
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,399
be a little uh little difficult to to

222
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,120
really understand.

223
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,880
Um in terms of the difference uh if you

224
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,200
think about uh spinal muscular atrophy

225
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,640
there are there are drugs uh that have

226
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,760
been approved. There's one called

227
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,320
Zorgensma which is an AAV9based

228
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
gene replacement therapy and that's

229
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,480
that's really what people are thinking

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,959
about uh when they think about gene

231
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
therapy and that is administered once

232
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,160
and then there is something called

233
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,040
spinraza which is a chronically

234
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
administered anti-ensor lianucleide and

235
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
typically speaking that's not what

236
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
people think about when they're talking

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,680
about gene therapy.

238
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,079
We also have a a third class here of

239
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,160
gene modified cell therapies. And this

240
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,920
is a little bit different in that cells

241
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
are harvested, they're taken out of the

242
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,760
body, they are modified outside of the

243
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,920
body and then they're returned into the

244
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,320
body. And examples of this are things

245
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,279
like the karti amunotherapies that we

246
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,360
hear about uh for cancers uh as well as

247
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,000
things like lentivirus mediated gene

248
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,079
therapies such as leneli for

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,839
metacromatic lucadistrophe which is

250
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,839
another approved product in the US.

251
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,959
So the delivery truck that we use to put

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,000
the gene therapy into humans is called a

253
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,760
vector and vectors can be viral and they

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
can be nonviral.

255
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,200
Um nonviral vectors typically require

256
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,680
repeated administrations and they there

257
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,560
are things like um lipid nanop particles

258
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,800
and different polymers. viral vectors

259
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,480
are typically delivered as a one-time

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,279
administration.

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,839
Um, and they've evolved to be to be um

262
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,920
probably the for the forefront of gene

263
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,839
therapy because scientists have

264
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,760
determined how to remove the the virus's

265
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,480
own pathogenic

266
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,079
uh DNA and replace it with the

267
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,839
therapeutic DNA. We know that genes are

268
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,920
naturally evolved to be good at getting

269
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,720
into cells. So this has proven to be a

270
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,000
very good way of delivering delivering

271
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:28,880
gene therapy to the cells of interest

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,279
using the virus's natural capability to

273
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,279
infect cells.

274
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,920
So gene therapy can be delivered

275
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,800
directly to a person uh in vivo or

276
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,880
xvivo. So xvivo is what I just described

277
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,040
where the cells are taken out of the

278
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,440
body. they are modified in a petri dish

279
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,320
or a test tube and then those modified

280
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,839
cells are put back into the into the um

281
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,240
into the person. Invivo gene therapy is

282
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,079
where the um the gene therapy is

283
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,600
developed and then in and then put

284
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,399
straight into the person. Um and the the

285
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,720
the route that you you that you put in

286
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,320
the invivo gene therapy kind of depend

287
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,880
depends on the um on the the disease

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,760
you're trying to treat. For CNS

289
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,240
disorders, often you will want to use a

290
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,639
local route of administration. So maybe

291
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,120
directly into uh into the spine uh or or

292
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,959
maybe via an intra cerebral ventricular

293
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,600
injection strict into the the brain

294
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,480
ventricles in the brain.

295
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,000
Um but there are other novel capsids um

296
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,519
sorry I'll come to capsids in a moment.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,399
There are novel um methods that enable

298
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,639
potentially enable uh introvenous

299
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:50,600
administration in development too.

300
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,600
There's the dry mouth coming.

301
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,560
So this cell here not this cell this

302
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,440
slide here is a little bit old. Uh this

303
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,680
data is from 2022.

304
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,279
um but I think broadly speaking it's

305
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,199
still um approximately correct still

306
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,839
today. So the most common viral vector

307
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:17,920
used is called an adeno associated

308
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:21,519
virus. Um and in 2022 about 20 65% of uh

309
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,240
clinical trials were using an AAV virus

310
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,399
followed by AAV was a lentivirus and a

311
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,399
lentivirus is typically administered

312
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,440
through Xvivo approaches. After that is

313
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,480
a denovo a deno virus and what I want to

314
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,720
highlight here is a deno virus and adeno

315
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,639
associated virus are completely

316
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,240
different viruses. They are unrelated

317
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,920
despite the name. Um adenoirus is a much

318
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,560
bigger virus and so you can actually

319
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,120
deliver much bigger genes but it's also

320
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,199
typically uh more immunogenic which

321
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,240
means it causes more of immune response

322
00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:00,240
which is why AEV has has evolved to be

323
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,480
uh more popular and then uh the nonviral

324
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,040
delivery methods so such as plasmids and

325
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,120
nanoparticles are gaining in in

326
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,680
popularity too. I would expect a higher

327
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,680
proportion um of these to be used. Now,

328
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,040
a number of gene therapies have been

329
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,800
approved for use by the FDA. I'm not

330
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,560
going to go through this. Seven of them

331
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,120
are AAV based, but but there are also um

332
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,920
lentiviral based and adenoviral based

333
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,920
gene therapies too.

334
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,040
So, what makes AAV appropriate for use

335
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,639
as a vector in gene therapy? Well,

336
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,920
importantly, even the wild type, which

337
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,120
means the natural uh AAV, is not known

338
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,440
to cause disease in humans. Um, and they

339
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,920
don't really trigger much of an immune

340
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,639
response, which means it's less likely

341
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,639
to cause side effects.

342
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,079
So

343
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,959
what we do as I mentioned is we take the

344
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,399
virus, we remove the original virus

345
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:06,800
genes and then we replace them with new

346
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,360
genetic material which is called the

347
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,279
trans gene.

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,920
The viral shell is called a capsid and

349
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,160
there are different kinds of capsids uh

350
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,120
that have a different tendency to go to

351
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,920
different parts of the body. This capsid

352
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,399
is called the serereotype.

353
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,639
The serereotype Aav9

354
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,079
has been has has been shown to cross the

355
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,120
bloodb brain barrier. Um and so it has

356
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,839
become one of the more popular um gene

357
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,680
therapies used for CNS disorders, but

358
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,000
there are others and there are also

359
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,440
novel capsids that are in development

360
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,120
too. One of the downsides of AAV is that

361
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,320
they can only carry very small genes.

362
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,639
It's a tiny virus. That means that some

363
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,120
diseases caused by larger genes might

364
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,040
not be treatable with conventional gene

365
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,880
replacement therapy which is where you

366
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,000
just give a replacement gene. Um

367
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,039
which means that novel um no novel ways

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,439
to modulate the disease may need to be

369
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,880
um developed. So this is the case for

370
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,160
Angelman syndrome with the EB UB3A gene

371
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,799
which can't fit inside the uh the AEV

372
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,720
capsid which means we have to have uh

373
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:28,240
new new ways of addressing it.

374
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:31,039
So the AEV is a tiny virus and it uh

375
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,840
it's taken into the cell by a small

376
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,240
bubble-like structure called an endoome.

377
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,080
It travels through the cytoplasm to the

378
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
nucleus of the cell which is the control

379
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,240
center of the cell which is where all of

380
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,320
all of our DNA normally lives.

381
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,000
Now two different different gene

382
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,880
therapies approach this differently. You

383
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,640
can have some gene therapies that will

384
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,960
for some viruses will insert

385
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,120
uh insert the genetic material into the

386
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,360
person's genome.

387
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,840
The AAV

388
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,640
forms delivers the genetic material and

389
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:12,720
that genetic material forms this small

390
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:16,400
circular st shape called an epiome and

391
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,880
it lives outside of your own DNA. So it

392
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,120
doesn't integrate into the the the

393
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,919
person's DNA. There are pros and cons

394
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,919
associated with both.

395
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,559
In terms of the trans gene, the elements

396
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:34,160
that we use resemble our our own

397
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:38,000
endogenous DNA. So we have the promoter

398
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,200
and that can be um natural or synthetic.

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,840
It can be cell specific or it can be ubi

400
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,400
ubiquitous so expressed everywhere. Then

401
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,120
you have the therapeutic trans gene. And

402
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,840
then you have regulatory elements that

403
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,280
enable you to modulate up and down where

404
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,280
and when the gene is expressed.

405
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,039
So historically, most gene therapies

406
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,760
have been used to deliver the the

407
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,880
missing protein um that causes the

408
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,160
disease. So that's called gene

409
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,160
replacement therapy.

410
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,480
But we can do much more than just

411
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,480
replace proteins.

412
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
So

413
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,840
these are all again fairly broad

414
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,400
categories. But we have we are have the

415
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,480
ability now to add functional copies,

416
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,160
regulate or silence gene to prevent

417
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,440
disease.

418
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:35,360
Um and really what what's the the the

419
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,360
approach we use depends on the outcomes

420
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,120
that you need and the fundamental basis

421
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,039
of the disease which is why it's really

422
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,360
important that we understand the

423
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,400
underlying herpathology and the

424
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,480
neurobiological processes of a disease.

425
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,080
So gene replacement is where we give a

426
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,559
gene and it um and it essentially

427
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,600
produces a new protein.

428
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,559
Gene regulation is where we deliver

429
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,360
transcription factors that adjust gene

430
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,919
activity by using these regulatory

431
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,120
elements. So this is the approach taken

432
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:11,280
uh by encoded for our program ETX 101

433
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,919
for dy syndrome which is a haplo

434
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,480
insufficiency meaning only one copy of

435
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,799
the gene works. So we deliver

436
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,400
transcription factors that bind to the

437
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,520
functional copy and turn up that missing

438
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,000
copy that that extra copy to produce

439
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:32,240
more protein.

440
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Gene silencing essentially allows us to

441
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,280
um to stop the stop the um translation

442
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:43,360
of toxic proteins that cause harm.

443
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,919
So with um with things like microRNAs,

444
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,640
small interfering RNAs, short hairpin

445
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:52,480
RNAs, essentially we um we deliver we

446
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,880
deliver these

447
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:59,679
RNAs that then bind to the messenger RNA

448
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,640
and stop that messenger RNA being read

449
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,919
and turned into protein. So, think of it

450
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,919
back to the assembly guide uh which the

451
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,000
workers need to be able to read and

452
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,880
produce the the product and these gi

453
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,400
these gene silencing technologies take a

454
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,880
black pen and scribble all over the

455
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,799
assembly guide so nobody can read it. Um

456
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,200
so that so that there is no product

457
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,280
produced.

458
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,440
And then gene editing is a little bit

459
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,080
different in that we use uh what we call

460
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,280
molecular scissors to go and edit the

461
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,360
person's DNA directly. So Michael talked

462
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,480
this morning about crisper and that

463
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,320
would be a gene editing technology.

464
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,240
So essentially we have a range of

465
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,440
different mechanisms that we can use

466
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,120
based off the disease that let us target

467
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,120
different conditions with customized

468
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,120
designs.

469
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,360
One of the important things about gene

470
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:04,159
therapies is that

471
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:07,600
once you give it, we hope that it lasts

472
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,360
forever and you can't take it away. That

473
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,840
means development of gene therapies is

474
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,960
complex and it involves a lot of

475
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,080
interdependent factors.

476
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,559
So it's absolutely critical that we

477
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,919
understand the disease biology so we can

478
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:26,480
design tools that address the underlying

479
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
cause of the disease.

480
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,919
As we've already heard, animal models

481
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:35,120
are really really important not only to

482
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,960
test safety but also so that we can

483
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,640
actually determine potentially

484
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:43,760
therapeutic doses for human trials.

485
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,159
again because because you we don't think

486
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,360
we can give gene therapy again yet. It's

487
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,159
I'll come to that in a moment. And um

488
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,640
you can't take it away. You want all of

489
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,880
the doses that you give in human trials

490
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,679
to be potentially efficacious based off

491
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,760
the work that you do in animal models.

492
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,520
So that animal research is absolutely

493
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,960
critical and has to be done very very

494
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,720
thoughtfully before you start humans.

495
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
We need a robust understanding of the

496
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,120
natural history of the disease. Uh we

497
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,120
need to again understand what are the

498
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,679
signs and the symptoms that we are

499
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,080
trying to address. Uh we need to be able

500
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,480
to then you understand what is

501
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,039
meaningful to the families and what do

502
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,039
we think that we can um change over the

503
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,440
time course of or time course of a

504
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,280
clinical trial so that we can um

505
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,679
so that we can select the right end

506
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,840
points for the clinical trial.

507
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,480
So the work that the angel community's

508
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,320
already been doing in this regard to to

509
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,880
to you know track and understand the

510
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,799
natural history is incredibly helpful

511
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,840
for people coming in to develop drugs.

512
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,000
Clinical trials for gene therapies are

513
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:58,720
complex. Um they

514
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,799
they are long and they because we are

515
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,039
trying to again address the range and

516
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,120
signs and symptoms. It means that we're

517
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,159
assessing a lot and families

518
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,320
participating you are really taking

519
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,640
taking a big step in participating it

520
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,279
it's a huge ask

521
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,919
typically speaking you know the the

522
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,840
primary end point so the first time

523
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,080
point at which you you assess is the

524
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,960
drug working is usually over the course

525
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,159
of about a year and then the FDA usually

526
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,080
requires that we follow patients for

527
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,880
five years and then maybe up to 15

528
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,440
years. So again, participating is a huge

529
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,919
commitment for families.

530
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,640
Regulatory processes are a little bit

531
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,000
different um to to traditional small

532
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,240
molecules. Um I won't go into that here.

533
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
Um and if you think about, you know, the

534
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,000
difference between gene therapy trials

535
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,400
versus say those four anti-seizure

536
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,960
medications that are just looking at

537
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,200
seizure reduction um and they're just

538
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,240
over, you know, three or four months. Um

539
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:05,039
it's really important to have patient

540
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,080
involvement in selecting the meaningful

541
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:10,240
end point and what an appropriate risk

542
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,279
benefit the the patient community is

543
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,080
willing to willing to tolerate. So it's

544
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:19,120
really important to get your feedback

545
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:22,640
when we're designing these trials.

546
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,640
And then given the single um the single

547
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,840
administration

548
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,679
uh aspect of gene therapy,

549
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,880
our reimbursement systems really aren't

550
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,520
set up to allow that. Um insurance

551
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,960
doesn't really know how to do that. So

552
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,720
we really do need to be working with

553
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,799
payers to evolve the commercial

554
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
paradigms so that we can make sure that

555
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,559
that patients are able to access these

556
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,720
therapies once they have regulatory

557
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,120
approval. That's a whole whole different

558
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,480
topic and I I won't go into that here.

559
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,039
Another thing just to be aware of and is

560
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,159
that we still don't really know the

561
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:02,960
optimal time for treatment in CNS

562
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,360
disorders. There is some evidence that

563
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,159
earlier treatment may lead to better

564
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,880
outcomes. It's going to be different on

565
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,600
for different disorders and a lot more

566
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,880
research is needed. But if you look at

567
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:22,279
the figure here, um, do I have No, I

568
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,279
can't do that. Uh, how do I go back?

569
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,559
Okay. If you look at the figure here on

570
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,279
there's a dotted line on the left just

571
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,799
coming up just under the word cognitive

572
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,320
that shows essentially neurotypical

573
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,559
development.

574
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,039
So unaffected children in a disorder

575
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,400
called Sanfalippo syndrome.

576
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,919
There is a red line there uh which shows

577
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,480
the natural history of children who did

578
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:55,360
not receive a treatment. And what this

579
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,520
figure really shows is that um there is

580
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,520
a child who was treated at about one

581
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,440
year of age and after two and a half

582
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,240
years of treatment that child is still

583
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,640
on the neurotypical trajectory.

584
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,120
Children treated around two years of age

585
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,080
are tracking also in that neurotypical

586
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,400
range. And then children who are treated

587
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,559
older than that don't have the same

588
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,960
outcomes.

589
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,120
Now, we don't expect this to be binary.

590
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,200
We still expect that older patients will

591
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,679
still be able to derive benefit. We just

592
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,080
don't know how long it's going to take

593
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,960
uh and and

594
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,240
we don't know how much. So when you're

595
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,279
testing a new therapy, you need to be

596
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,600
sure that the effect you are seeing or

597
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,120
not seeing is as a result of the

598
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
therapy.

599
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,440
That means that often in these

600
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,080
neurodedevelopmental disorders, we have

601
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,400
to start young because the youngest

602
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,480
patients are the ones that we anticipate

603
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,640
should be able to have the fastest

604
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,080
responses over the time course of a

605
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,399
clinical trial. Um

606
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,039
and then once we've demonstrated that

607
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,960
the drug works in those patients, then

608
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,520
we can go into older patients to study

609
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,679
that. It turns the sort of the

610
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,240
traditional drug development paradigm on

611
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,320
its head because normally you start in

612
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,000
adults and you work younger for new but

613
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,320
for neurodedevelopmental disorders where

614
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,320
you're again trying to trying to address

615
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
the whole range of signs and symptoms of

616
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,720
the disease. You need to start younger

617
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,640
and then move older. But a lot more work

618
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,279
is needed to be done on this to really

619
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,640
understand um what you know what what

620
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,640
this means for each individual disorder.

621
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,080
So when delivering anything to the

622
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,960
immune system, the immune system reacts.

623
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,240
Um and this is the same for gene

624
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,039
therapy. We want to be sure that

625
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,520
um that we're controlling any immune

626
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,039
response to to that that foreign

627
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,279
material that's being introduced into

628
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,679
the body. So there sort of three

629
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:06,480
different buckets that we think about

630
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,960
because these viruses naturally occur.

631
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Some people may have been exposed to the

632
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,799
wild type virus in in the years before

633
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,520
gene therapy. So those patients might

634
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,440
have pre-existing immunity which if you

635
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,880
then administer the gene therapy the

636
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,960
immune system may essentially im mount a

637
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,600
response and to stop it from delivering

638
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,159
the the therapy.

639
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,880
Uh there's also innate immunity. So

640
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,520
immediately uh in the hours after gene

641
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,000
therapy the immune system again may see

642
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,000
this virus and mount an immune response

643
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,679
against it. And then you have adaptive

644
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
immunity which can happen in the days or

645
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,440
weeks after gene therapy.

646
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,520
where the immune system can develop

647
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
stronger responses like antibodies or

648
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,240
te- cells that can attack either the

649
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,799
gene therapy or even the treated cells.

650
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,200
To prevent this, we test for antibodies

651
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,200
before we uh give treatment. And

652
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,279
sometimes patients who already have an

653
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
immune response may be excluded

654
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,840
especially for the early stage trials

655
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,600
again where we're trying to figure out

656
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,240
does the thing does the gene therapy

657
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,919
work or not. We also use medicines

658
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,120
called immunosuppressions to calm the

659
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,520
immune response before and after. And

660
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,360
then we monitor patients very carefully

661
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,559
uh over time to manage any potential

662
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,279
immune responses.

663
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,120
So there are important considerations

664
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,200
many of which I've already touched upon

665
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,360
here. Understanding the disease symptoms

666
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,279
and progression is critical. Um and

667
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,840
again all the work you've done is is

668
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,279
really helping helping develop therapies

669
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,279
because we understand Angelman syndrome.

670
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,440
Uh there are delivery channels

671
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,039
challenges in hard-to-reach tissues. So

672
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,360
again you know if you want to go into

673
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,240
the CNS you may need invasive routes of

674
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,480
administration.

675
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,919
uh as uh as one of the speakers already

676
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,480
mentioned this morning, pre-clinical

677
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,960
studies are vitally important, but

678
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,640
animals are not humans and they don't

679
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,399
always predict what happens in humans.

680
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,840
So, we have to be very thoughtful and

681
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:10,559
very and very careful before and as we

682
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,120
start uh human studies.

683
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,799
We are delivering billions of viral

684
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,559
particles to patients. Uh and so very

685
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,480
high doses of this may cause side

686
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,360
effects in the liver. So again we need

687
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,399
to be very careful um and and these

688
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,159
immune responses may limit future dosing

689
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:30,240
um or repeat administrations which means

690
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,240
you need to be um we need to approach

691
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,159
clinical trials a little differently

692
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,720
because we can't do traditional dose

693
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,480
finding studies

694
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,240
and everything given everything I just

695
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,120
said you know long-term follow-up is

696
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,440
needed this is still a nent field we are

697
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,000
you know I' I've been doing this for uh

698
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,919
over a decade now um and we have a lot

699
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,240
more experience

700
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,320
in that than when I started, but it's

701
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,080
still you we're still learning a lot and

702
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,159
so following people over time is going

703
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,039
to be really important. But I don't want

704
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,559
to sound overly negative. Uh the data

705
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,919
that is coming out is incredibly

706
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,760
exciting. Um a lot of the approved gene

707
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,080
therapies show a very favorable risk

708
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,080
benefit and there is a lot of potential

709
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,240
now for for conditions that were once

710
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,480
thought untreatable.

711
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,840
On my last slide, I just, you know,

712
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,440
given everything I've just said, um, you

713
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,000
development of gene therapies really

714
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,120
does take a village. Uh, you know, in

715
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,799
sponsors and families and clinicians and

716
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,640
regulators and pairs all really need to

717
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,360
be working very closely together to help

718
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,559
advance these these therapies forward.

719
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,600
Thank you for your time and attention

720
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,600
and happy to take any questions.

721
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,840
Thank you. Welcome. Great.

722
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,519
>> Okay, I don't think we have time for

723
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,799
questions.

724
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,640
>> Thank you very much. Um, so ultimately I

725
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:55,600
think you know what we learned today is

726
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,399
that we start with things in a dish. We

727
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,880
move to things in animal testing. We

728
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,120
understand what we're putting into these

729
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,039
drugs in order to try to replace UB3A

730
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,799
and how we may want to get it there.

731
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,039
Whether that's through a virus, whether

732
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,720
that's through a lipid particle, whether

733
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,880
that's through some type of editing

734
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,000
carrier. um all different ways that

735
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,000
we're going to talk about over the next

736
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,120
couple days. But I think what's also

737
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,799
important to realize is that I I know a

738
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,399
lot of people just heard that talk and

739
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,720
are super excited, but also heard that

740
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,240
um in certain examples of certain gene

741
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,440
therapies that are having a profound

742
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,760
impact on patients. Almost all of the

743
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,399
gene therapies where there's data which

744
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,840
Emma showed is in neurodeenerative

745
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,760
disorders showing that if you address a

746
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,480
neurodeenerative disorder before there

747
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,279
are symptoms you can you can tra on a

748
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,600
normal neurodedevelopmental trajectory

749
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,279
in a neurodedevelopmental disorder like

750
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,760
Angelmen that is not degenerative

751
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,320
where we are on that trajectory and

752
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,760
where we intervene and where we're going

753
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,840
to see the greatest benefit is

754
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,960
completely unknown.

755
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,519
What the animal models actually show if

756
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,520
we want to believe anything is that it

757
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,280
doesn't matter what age you actually

758
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,599
intervene and you'll see that over the

759
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,320
course of the next two days. You can see

760
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:18,879
profound benefit at different ages.

761
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,800
Similar whether it's adolescent, adult

762
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,560
or newborn in some therapeutics where

763
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,800
you can really distribute well to the

764
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,040
brain. And so it's really important that

765
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,320
we don't get deflated. If we're not two

766
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,159
years old, we're not going to see

767
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,839
benefit. That's not what she was saying.

768
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,639
She was just showing an example in a

769
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:38,800
degenerative disorder in which you can

770
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,399
not even see a symptom if you treat

771
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,240
early enough before there's degeneration

772
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,320
of the brain. But I want to acknowledge

773
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,240
that in Angelmen, for the example we

774
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,159
have over the next couple days, we we

775
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,000
don't have degener degeneration of the

776
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,159
brain, but we want to address the

777
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,800
symptoms as early as possible so our

778
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,560
kids don't have to live a long period of

779
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,160
time with the symptoms of Angelmen

780
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,200
syndrome. And that's our ultimate goal.

781
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,200
So, I just want to make that super
