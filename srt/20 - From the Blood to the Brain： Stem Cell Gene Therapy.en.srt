1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,760
Okay, why don't we have a seat so we can

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,879
get started.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,040
So the

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,960
presentations that are coming up,

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,040
there's no time for questions. There's

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,480
no time for a comment. There's five

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,880
minutes, five slides, content only. I've

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,480
instructed everybody presenting that

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,640
they don't need to explain to parents

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,080
what Angelmen syndrome is. They

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,680
certainly don't need to explain to us

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,880
what the symptoms of Angelmen syndrome

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
are. All we want to know is what have

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,040
they done and what are the results and

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
how is this going to help my child. That

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
is the only thing we want to hear from

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,559
them. And if they don't tell us that

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,879
they're not going to get voted the best

19
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,440
abstract in the lightning round and

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,640
that's how this is going to work. So we

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,920
want to make sure that at the end don't

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,840
leave. I'm going to we're going to get

23
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,760
you the QR code. think it's in the Cvent

24
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,039
app, but I I will get you exactly what

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,800
it is and where it is and you guys could

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
take a picture at the end and everybody

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,960
can vote and we'll we'll call out the

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,520
winner tomorrow morning. Um, but I'm

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,799
very excited to really be able to share

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,720
with you the results. All of your money,

31
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,520
all of your time, all of your anxiety

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,159
and excitement comes to fruition when

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,520
you see results. So, this is just a

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,880
round presentation after presentation in

35
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,759
lay language. What are your results? So,

36
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,200
we're going to start with a presentation

37
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,600
which is from blood to brain stem cell

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,320
gene therapy for Angelmen syndrome.

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,720
Colin Jwitt from UCLA is going to give

40
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,799
us the cliffhanger

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,400
before Don Cohen's presentation tomorrow

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,960
who is keynote who's going to talk to us

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,960
about the HSC gene therapy program.

44
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,960
Colin

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,720
So, hi everyone. I'll be sort of giving

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,439
a teaser for the talk that Don Conn will

47
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
be giving tomorrow. Um, which is going

48
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,479
to go over how we can use the blood to

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,799
treat the brain. Uh, I first want to go

50
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,280
over how that can happen. Uh, so looking

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,000
at the left, you can see how blood stem

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,640
cell gene therapy works. uh essentially

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,800
the blood stem cells are mobilized from

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,599
the bone marrow and then extracted from

55
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,000
the patient. Then in the lab we can

56
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,920
treat those blood stem cells with some

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
type of viral vector and this

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,959
essentially delivers a therapeutic gene

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,560
to the patient stem cells. Then those

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,360
stem cells that have been treated are

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,280
returned to the patient in a bone marrow

62
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,120
transplant. So the patients effectively

63
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
become their own bone marrow transplant

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,280
donor.

65
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,120
uh these stem cells then do the

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
important job of creating all of the

67
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,280
blood in the body. So this also includes

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,280
the immune cells during the

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,519
transplantation process. You can see on

70
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,480
the right that immune cells called

71
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,519
monocytes can migrate across the blood

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,560
brain the bloodb brain barrier and

73
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,040
engraft into the niche of the brain. So

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,599
you can imagine if we use a viral vector

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,400
that transforms the immune cells such

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,560
that they will secrete UB3A. When these

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
immune cells migrate into the brain,

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,319
they can then secrete UB3A to

79
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,879
neighboring deficient neurons

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,800
effectively becoming a little uh cell

81
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
factory is like how we like to think

82
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
about it.

83
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,319
We assessed this strategy in Angelmen

84
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
syndrome mice using two different

85
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,560
vectors and compared this to wild type

86
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,080
and angelman syndrome mice that were not

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,760
treated.

88
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,959
You can see here on the left this is

89
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,120
results from the roto rod assay. Uh in

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,799
this assay mice are placed on a rotating

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,720
rod and um the measure of time until

92
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,120
they fall is sort of a measure of motor

93
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
function. You can see that the treated

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,080
mice in red and blue using vector 1 and

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,000
two perform very similarly to the wild

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,239
type mice uh which are in purple. Uh and

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
very excitingly they perform uh

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,120
significantly better than the untreated

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,360
Angelmen syndrome mice in brown.

100
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,799
So this demonstrates that the therapy is

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
working to treat the motor function

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,760
phenotype of Angelmen syndrome. On the

103
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,400
right this is results of a novel object

104
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,480
recognition assay. In this assay, mice

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,959
are essentially shown a object they are

106
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,959
familiar with and a new novel object.

107
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
Uh, neotypical mice will be more

108
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,440
interested in this novel object and

109
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
interact with it more. Uh, and it's

110
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
characterized that Angelman syndrome

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
mice do not interact as much with the

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
novel object. So, what we have plotted

113
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
here is a discrimination index score.

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,080
Um, the score very simply, if it's a

115
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,639
positive number, it's a sign uh that the

116
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,800
mouse is behaving neurotypically uh and

117
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,720
behaving with the novel object more. So

118
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,479
you can see that the wild type mice, as

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
you'd expect, all have a positive

120
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,880
discrimination index score. And very

121
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,400
excitingly, all of the treated mice as

122
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
well have that uh positive

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,479
discrimination index score. So it's

124
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,440
showing that cognitive function has been

125
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,440
improved in these treated mice.

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,600
Next up, this uh data is new this year,

127
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,680
and we're very excited to share it. Uh

128
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,960
the mice were assessed for their delta

129
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,960
power over a 24-hour recording period.

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,560
And you can see that as described

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,160
throughout the day, the Angelman

132
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,280
syndrome mice have a characteristic

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,600
elevated delta power level in brown uh

134
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,759
during that 24-hour period. But then the

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,000
treated mice follow the same trajectory

136
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
as the wild type mice uh following that

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,160
purple line. And this has also been

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
quantified on the right for everyone. Uh

139
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,039
this is the average delta power over

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,039
that 24hour recording period. You can

141
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,120
see that there's a significant decrease

142
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,840
in the red and the blue compared to the

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,600
brown untreated control. Uh whereas the

144
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,560
wild type uh and it actually achieves

145
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,639
the same level as the wild type mice. So

146
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,720
again, this was just sort of a summary.

147
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
Um and what I hope you can take away is

148
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,479
that the symptoms in adult ancient

149
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,120
syndrome mice marketkedly improved

150
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,520
following the stem cell gene therapy.

151
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,199
Both vectors uh utilize promoters that

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,759
have shown a very safe clinical track

153
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,400
record. Uh and Dr. con's talk tomorrow

154
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
at 8:30 will discuss this further and so

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,680
these results you know it's still just

156
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,680
in a mouse model but we're very

157
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,160
encouraged so fast transformatics and

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
UCLA have teamed up to perform the

159
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,840
translational studies that are necessary

160
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,680
to then enable a human clinical trial

161
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,440
so I'd like to thank everyone on this

162
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,560
slide especially Chris Luther's who

163
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,400
really led these studies at UCLA uh fast

164
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
for the endless support not just in

165
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,600
funding the project but supporting it

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,520
from every stage that we've been that um

167
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,080
and lastly all of you for listening.

168
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,080
Thank you very much.

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
That was fabulous.
