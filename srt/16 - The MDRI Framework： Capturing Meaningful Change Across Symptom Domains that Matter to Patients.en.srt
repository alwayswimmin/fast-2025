1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,880
So, next I'm excited to introduce Dr.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,240
Kim Goodspeed, who leads the GTX 102

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,919
clinical trial at Ultragenics. She's

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,519
going to be talking to us about um a

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,719
framework that we've heard about before,

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,120
but not explicitly called the MDRI or

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,560
the multi-dommain responder index, which

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,080
really can capture some of the

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,279
meaningful changes in Angelmen Syndrome.

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,080
So, I'm going to let her explain to you

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,080
exactly what that is.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,760
Almost there. Hello everybody. What

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,760
great talks we've had today, right? Um,

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
so as Allison mentioned, I'm Kim

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,840
Goodspeed. I'm uh the clinical lead for

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,440
GTX 102 at Ultragenics. Uh, really

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,920
honored to be here. I'm a child

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,680
neurologist by training and um just

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
thrilled to be getting to work with this

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
community still. So, first and foremost,

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,520
thank you. Uh, thanks for being here,

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,039
for listening. thanks to all our um

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,199
families who have participated in our

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,559
trials and all of our investigators and

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,000
your study teams who have made those

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,039
trials happen. So without you guys um

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
none of this data would exist and

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,840
because we're um have some opportunities

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,640
here, I wanted to be able to dive into

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
the methodology behind our MDRI. So

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
that's really what we're going to kind

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,920
of focus on today is what is this tool

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that we've kind of shown you a couple of

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,520
times now. Um but we can dive into it a

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,960
little bit deeper. But first and

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,840
foremost um GTX 102 is not an approved

37
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,759
product. Right? So it's an

38
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
investigational drug and the data we are

39
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,759
going to look at today is from an uh

40
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,360
interim data from an open label study.

41
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,880
So it's not definitive. And again I

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,479
really want to focus on the methodology

43
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,560
today and kind of what are the nuts and

44
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,880
bolts of the MDRI the multi-dommain

45
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,759
responder index.

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
But first, can I also tell you that the

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,320
reason we think about things like the

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,960
MDRI is because we know that in

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
especially rare disease clinical trials,

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600
selecting a single primary efficacy

51
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
endpoint can be really challenging. But

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,799
that's generally how clinical trials are

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,240
set up. So they're designed to evaluate

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,320
efficacy based on this one symptom and

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
you measure it in one particular way and

56
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,479
you need to have most of the trial

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,160
participants improve in that particular

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
symptom.

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
So in order to demonstrate that

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,080
therapeutic benefit on that particular

61
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,760
symptom, you probably need to make sure

62
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
that most of the individuals in the

63
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,599
trial have that symptom when they come

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,040
into the trial. Well, in some scenarios,

65
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,040
that might end up narrowing the

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,280
population of individuals that you get

67
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,959
to study. And then you get into some

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,720
questions around well how much can we

69
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,959
generalize this data if we had to limit

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,519
our study population to this one

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
particular symptom.

72
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,760
But even more than that I think we're in

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
a new era right we learned all kinds of

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,000
interesting things about ASOS gene

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,599
therapies um crisper therapies this

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,599
morning these are all designed to treat

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,080
the underlying cause of Angelman

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,879
syndrome which we know doesn't manifest

79
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,800
as just one symptom. So if we're

80
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,239
treating the underlying cause, you can

81
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,480
imagine that individuals are going to

82
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
benefit in different ways because they

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,879
have different symptoms at the

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
beginning. And so we know that even

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,080
drugs that exist today can impact

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
patients in many many different ways,

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
but the trials that were used to approve

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,040
those drugs really had to rely on that

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
single primary efficacy endpoint. So our

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,480
solution is the MDRI, so the

91
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,680
multi-dommain responder index, and it's

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,360
a way to evaluate the data looking at

93
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,480
all these different symptom domains at a

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,519
single time um in one analytical tool.

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,080
So let's talk about what it is. So

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,280
again, it's an analytical strategy. It's

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,920
a tool that we can use to see different

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,000
symptoms and how individual participants

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,360
from that trial respond to each of those

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
different symptoms and then kind of

101
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,920
tally up the data to see the overall

102
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,760
responder rate.

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
So, it's important that each of these

104
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,959
symptoms that we're measuring are

105
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,239
clinically distinct and are important.

106
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,599
And so, these are the five we've

107
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
identified for Angelman syndrome. And

108
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,480
we'll talk a little bit more about that,

109
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,400
but most of that data actually came from

110
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,000
y'all again. So from your disease

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
concept studies, your natural history

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
studies, you have taught us what is

113
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,720
important and what we need to measure.

114
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,599
And so those are the key aspects that

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
we've focused on. Now what is the MDRI

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
not? It is not a composite endpoint

117
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,599
which it often gets kind of confused or

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,519
lumped with. The difference that I think

119
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,359
is the main difference is that in the

120
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,160
MTRI we get to measure different

121
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,919
symptoms with different endpoints and

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,560
they're all thought to be clinically

123
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,639
meaningful for the population. A

124
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,800
composite endpoint is really taking one

125
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,199
symptom but measuring that symptom in a

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
lot of different ways. So this coronary

127
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,240
artery example here at the bottom is

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,440
showing you that we're have all these

129
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
different ways that we can measure

130
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,320
coronary artery disease um from kind of

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,840
milder to more severe ways of measuring

132
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,680
it versus taking different symptoms and

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,960
manifestations of Angelmen syndrome. So

134
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,840
it's a little bit of a nuance difference

135
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,240
but an important one.

136
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,639
So how does it work? Um you initially

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,400
identify anywhere from four to six. We

138
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,759
picked the sweet spot of five for this

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,000
trial. Um clinically meaningful domains.

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,520
So symptoms and they need to be

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
important. So they have to be things

142
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,120
that you care about as a community and

143
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,280
they need to be independent and be able

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
to measure it independently.

145
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
And then we identify a clinical endpoint

146
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,639
that appropriately measures each of

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,479
those symptoms. And then we define a

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
meaningful score difference. So, what is

149
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,320
the smallest change that we think would

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
be an indicator of improvement or

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,360
worsening? And then we assign a score to

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
that. So, here in the middle of the

153
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
screen, we've got the pink, the white,

154
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,520
and the green boxes. So, [snorts] if

155
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,520
that meaningful score difference is met

156
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,520
or surpassed in the direction of

157
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,320
improvement, we assign that a score of

158
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,560
plus one. If it's met or surpassed in

159
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,639
the direction of worsening, we assign it

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
a score of minus one and give it a pink

161
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,320
color. If it falls somewhere in the

162
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,000
middle, we say, "We're not sure if

163
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,120
that's clinically meaningful or not. We

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,520
don't know if that's a true treatment

165
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,160
effect." And so we uh leave that box

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,720
white and we give it a score of zero.

167
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,840
You tally up all of these scores to give

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,759
you your net responder uh net response.

169
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,479
So like in this little theoretical

170
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,199
example here, uh domain one is a plus

171
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,720
one because they improved. Uh z domain

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,520
two and five, there wasn't a clear

173
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,000
change, so that's a zero point. Three

174
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,240
gets a plus one. four is a minus one.

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
Sum that up, you get a plus one net

176
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
score.

177
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
Then you look at this through the entire

178
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
group, apply some statistical analyses

179
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,120
to it, and decide if it's statistically

180
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,880
significant or not. And we've already

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,560
said that each of these boxes is

182
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,319
clinically meaningful. So then we get to

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
apply the statistical analysis on top of

184
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,440
that. And then we display the results as

185
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,720
a responder index. So for Angelman

186
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,120
Syndrome, we started with the domains.

187
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
these really truly came from your

188
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,039
conceptual model. So what are the things

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,199
that are the unmet need and things that

190
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,800
we can measure in a trial um and that

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,360
are important to you that they could

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,440
potentially improve with treatment. So

193
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,440
sleep, motor, behavior, communication,

194
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,960
cognition. And then um the next sorry

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,319
we've got some formatting stuff that was

196
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,160
not on my laptop but um then we identify

197
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,599
which endpoints we assign to each of

198
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,919
those. So this data comes from our phase

199
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,560
one two data. We measured for example

200
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,800
sleep in many different ways and then we

201
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,280
look at our data and say which one do we

202
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,240
think is actually capturing what

203
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,160
families care about and we also ask you

204
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,759
which of these measures seems like it's

205
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,080
capturing what you care about and what

206
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,680
do you care about and then we land on

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
which endpoint we think is the most

208
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,080
appropriate to assign to that clinical

209
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,840
domain. So in this case, we used our um

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,360
Angelman syndrome severity assessment

211
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,440
scale. It's a scale that's completed by

212
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,120
the clinician and we're using the sleep

213
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
domain

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,400
um and so forth throughout um each of

215
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,360
those clinical endpoints. Then we define

216
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,599
the uh MSD or the meaningful score

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
difference. This has been term has

218
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,440
shifted a lot over time. So you may have

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,280
heard it called an MID or minimal

220
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
important difference before. There's a

221
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
number of different acronyms, but

222
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
essentially all it means is what is that

223
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,000
scores threshold that we think if we go

224
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,599
beyond it, that would mean a clinical

225
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,039
improvement that would be meaningful to

226
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,720
you. So, they're all listed here and

227
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,879
that again formatting is coming out kind

228
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,039
of wonky. Um, but it's a plus or minus

229
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,400
one for the first two, a plus or minus

230
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,440
six for the next two, and a plus or

231
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,120
minus five for the last one.

232
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,520
And then we look at it across all of

233
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,800
these kids. Um this is a sampling from

234
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,680
our cohorts A and B. And so to orient

235
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,919
you to that graph, uh we have each

236
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,599
column representing an individual

237
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,399
symptom domain that's being measured by

238
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,800
one of those clinical endpoints. Each

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,959
row is a participant

240
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,200
and then we code each box by that color.

241
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,680
So if they met or surpassed the

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
meaningful score difference in the uh

243
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,160
improvement direction, we color it

244
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,480
green. If they met passed in the

245
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,200
worsening direction, we color it pink.

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,279
And if there was not a clear change or

247
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
wasn't a sufficient change to meet

248
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,320
either of those thresholds, we leave it

249
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:12,399
white. Every green box gets a plus one,

250
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,040
every white box gets a zero, and every

251
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,600
pink box gets a minus one. So let's look

252
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,240
at a couple of examples.

253
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,519
So participant one from the top of that

254
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,480
last graph, they had a improvement in

255
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,320
each one of these domains. So surpassed

256
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,080
each of those clinically meaningful

257
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,040
thresholds in the direction of

258
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,959
improvement. So 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1

259
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,760
plus 1 gives us five. That's the max

260
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,360
score.

261
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,839
Another participant though that had some

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,800
variable responses improved in three

263
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,519
domains that are all colored green. They

264
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,440
didn't have a clear change in um two

265
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,440
domains. And so that gives us an overall

266
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,080
score of plus three for this individual.

267
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,959
And one more example. So we've got a

268
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,360
score uh a domain that wasn't clearly

269
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,160
changed. We've got two domains that met

270
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
or surpassed that uh clinical worsening

271
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
and we've got two domains that met or

272
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,160
surpassed clinical improvement and they

273
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,399
get a net score of zero. So it's a

274
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,320
really interesting way to be able to

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
look at all of these kids. I'm not

276
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,760
actually going to go back to this slide

277
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,800
one more time, but it's a nice way to

278
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,680
look at all these kids um from a bird's

279
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,079
eye view and Overall, you can see that

280
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,200
kids are responding in different ways.

281
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,800
Um, and some kids aren't responding in

282
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,160
certain domains. And we don't know if

283
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,760
that's because they didn't have that

284
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,360
symptom to begin with and it just was

285
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,040
never a problem, so it didn't need to

286
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,279
change or what exactly happened, but it

287
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,079
does give us a sense that we can get

288
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,079
these variable responses. The other nice

289
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,880
thing is you're not just limited to this

290
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,399
analysis. It's a super powerful tool in

291
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,480
conjunction with everything else we do

292
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,399
to analyze our data and be able to look

293
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,000
at everything on the continuous scale.

294
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,640
So we're looking at it in graphs where

295
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,160
we're plotting it out by group and

296
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,600
understanding what the group is also

297
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,200
doing on each one of these measures

298
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,519
individually. So hopefully I have shared

299
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,240
a little bit of the secret sauce behind

300
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,320
the MDRI. Um again it's it's a

301
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,720
analytical tool. It's a different way to

302
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
visualize the data and understand the

303
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
clinically meaningful improvements that

304
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,399
we see across multiple domains um using

305
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,680
a single tool. It allows for enrollment

306
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,760
of a broader population potentially and

307
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,320
allows you to also then look at safety

308
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,160
across a more diverse population which

309
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,640
can also help with our interpretability

310
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,240
and generalizability of all of these uh

311
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,720
results.

312
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
So we think it's a great tool. Um we

313
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,959
think it's especially great in

314
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,680
populations like yours that have complex

315
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,279
phenotypes, complex presentations, um,

316
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,040
and a really nice way to be able to

317
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,040
analyze the data. Thank you.

318
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,320
>> Thank you for that. And and thank you

319
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,760
for for willing the willingness and the

320
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,440
attempt to actually try to capture our

321
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
kids holistically rather than try to put

322
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
them in separate buckets of which we

323
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,440
know that Angelman syndrome is a diverse

324
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,120
and global disorder and holistic capture

325
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,200
of clinical domains that are of meaning

326
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,200
is incredibly important to these event.
