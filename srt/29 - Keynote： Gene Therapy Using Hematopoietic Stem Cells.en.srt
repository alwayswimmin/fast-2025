1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
I'm really thrilled to be able to

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,240
present our keynote speaker. Our keynote

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,920
speaker is Dr. Don Conn um from the

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,920
University of California um UCLA.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,560
He's a distinguished professor professor

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,520
of pediatrics, immunology, and molecular

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,240
genetics. Um he's a pediatric bone

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,480
marrow transplant physician. and he

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,320
focuses on developing blood stem cell

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,400
therapies for genetic disorders,

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,279
including the development of the first

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,559
successful bone stem cell gene therapy

13
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,840
for a disorder called ADA Skid, as many

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,600
of you might know as bubble baby.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
Babies are born without an immune system

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,440
and they generally die before the age of

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
two.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
And Don, I don't want to say

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,039
single-handedly because he probably

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
won't let me say that, but almost

21
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,399
single-handedly

22
00:00:50,960 --> 00:01:00,360
has cured, I use the word cure,

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,360
over 50 babies with ADA skin.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,400
And that is a single gene disorder that

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
has been eradicated with this type of

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,439
gene therapy.

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,680
And so I'll tell you a little story

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,280
about how we met Don and why Don's here

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,880
because he works on bone marrow

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,400
transplant. You might wonder why in the

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,759
world we bring an immunologist

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,280
transplant physician to the FAST summit.

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,240
And it's because in 2016

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
we worked to create a type of gene

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,040
therapy called hematopoetic stem cell

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,520
gene therapy with an incredible team at

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,960
UC Davis.

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,880
And we are high-risisk, high reward and

39
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,439
everyone told us it would never work for

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,920
Angelman syndrome. But we saw the

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,520
literature about brain diseases that

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
were being treated with this type of

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,759
therapy because it can cross the bloodb

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
brain barrier and get to all of the

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,759
neurons of the brain. And there was no

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,920
reason to believe it wouldn't help

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,079
Angelmen syndrome outside of a lot of

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,759
scientists not understanding the

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,759
mechanism. Therefore, it couldn't be

50
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,280
possible. And in classic form, fast

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
said, "Don't tell me something's not

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,160
possible. We'll tell you if it's

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
possible." And so we decided to fund

54
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,560
this program thanks to the support of

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
Dr. Dave Seagull, who brought to us a

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,840
team that said, "Let's try it." And we

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,760
did. And it completely cured the adult

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
Angelman syndrome mouse model. For the

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,400
first time, any therapy had actually

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,400
treated every single gen phenotype.

61
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,800
And we were so excited that we were

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,040
going to be able to truly truly see a

63
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
transformation like this and we wanted

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,640
to push it as quickly as we could to the

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,280
clinic. But unfortunately, the year we

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,400
took the license and decided to push it,

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,120
news came out that a part of the gene

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,840
therapy that we were using, which Dr.

69
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Con will talk about actually was

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,959
associated with some types of blood

71
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,720
cancer. And we needed to change that

72
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,040
part of the gene therapy because there

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,280
were other similar ones that were out

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,519
there that had this part, a promoter

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,519
that had a track record for decades of

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,760
safety. And this promoter did not have

77
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,000
that track record. And so Jennifer and I

78
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,360
said, "Well, who can help us change this

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,159
promoter? How do we figure this out? And

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,080
we looked up the person in a press

81
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,360
release talking about the promiscuous

82
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,120
promoter, the expert in the world that

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,080
had been doing this type of gene therapy

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,680
longer than anyone. His name was Dr. Don

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,159
Conn. So in standard fashion, we emailed

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,560
Dr. Don Conn and said, "Would you be

87
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:54,000
willing to work on Angelmen Syndrome?"

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,799
And his response was, "Sure, why not?"

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,439
And so here we are. It's been two years

90
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,920
and we finally have a human candidate to

91
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,239
be able to push hopefully in the very

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
near term toward a human clinical trial.

93
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,519
So with that, Donna is going to talk to

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,159
you about the journey of hematopoetic

95
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,159
stem cell gene therapy.

96
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,360
Well, thank you amazing Allison. Uh

97
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,360
well, hello everyone. So yes, I why am I

98
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
here? Um I'll hopefully by the time I'm

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
done talking you'll get the connection

100
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,040
between bone marrow transplant and

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,120
angelman syndrome and which is still

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,280
hypothetical but we hopefully we could

103
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,440
have a therapy that could be beneficial.

104
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,479
Um so um there there's I'm mult in

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,720
multiple departments at UCLA. Uh so this

106
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,720
is what I'll I'll talk about. Um I'll

107
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,880
I'll cover sort of a little background

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,440
on blood and blood forming hematopoetic

109
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,400
it's a word will be on the test. uh stem

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
cells and gene therapy. Um and then I'll

111
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440
talk about the work that Allison

112
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,120
referred to, our work for many years on

113
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,120
severe combined immune deficiency,

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,199
that's bubble baby disease, and really

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,360
to show you what can be done with this

116
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,240
type of therapy. Um I've been at that

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,240
for a long time. Um and we, you know,

118
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,160
now we have it working well. And then

119
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
I'll the main part of the talk will be

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,800
about Angelman syndrome and how this can

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,120
be applied possibly to it. And as

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,880
Allison said, the um data in the mouse

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,400
that was developed at Davis, which you

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
heard yesterday from Colin from my lab,

125
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
we've completely been able to reproduce

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,639
the exact same amazing findings in the

127
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,360
mouse model, underlies the idea of

128
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,199
bringing this to patients.

129
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,800
Uh so first the part about blood and

130
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,240
hematopotic stem cells. So um we don't

131
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
all think about blood very much, but if

132
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,160
we take a drop of blood and put it on a

133
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,759
slide and stain it, these are the type

134
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
kind of cells that we see in blood. So

135
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,720
there's the red blood cells that are

136
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,479
basically packed with hemoglobin and

137
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,320
carry oxygen. There's a different type

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
of white cells that are mainly immune

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,720
cells and there's the little platelets

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,440
down in the corner that stop bleeding.

141
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,000
So all of those cells come from the

142
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,759
hematopoetic or blood forming stem cell

143
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,479
and those are mainly for us in the bone

144
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,560
marrow. And so on on your left there in

145
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,400
in the box are the hematopetic stem cell

146
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
sort of like the parent cells for the

147
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
blood cells. And so over our life that

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,120
population of cells divides and self

149
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,960
renews and maintains a compartment. But

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,800
then some of them go on to change and

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
differentiate to make all the mature

152
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,080
blood cells shown at the right. And so

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,720
clinically if we want bone marrow stem

154
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,319
cells to transplant the the classical

155
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,919
way is doing a bone marrow harvest. So

156
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,240
it's an operation where patients the

157
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,000
donor is asleep with needles into the

158
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
back of the pelvic bone. We extract bone

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,240
marrow. That's largely been replaced

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
now. although occasionally we we do take

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,639
bone marrow. Um, another source is the

162
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,880
umbilical cord blood. So it turns out at

163
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
the time a baby is born, they have these

164
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
same hematopotic stem cells in

165
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
circulation. So if you capture the blood

166
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,919
that's in the umbilical cord, which is

167
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,680
the babies, you can use that to

168
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,520
transplant. Usually there's enough cells

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,680
to transplant a child, not often enough

170
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,440
for an adult. And what's most used

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,280
commonly now are mobilizing the stem

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,039
cells from the bone marrow into the

173
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,720
peripheral blood and collecting them.

174
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,599
I'll show you a diagram of that. So

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
mobilize peripheral blood. And so the

176
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,319
way I think of these cells is that the

177
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,440
stem cells are the babies. They have

178
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
their whole life ahead of themselves.

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,720
They become any type of cell. Then in

180
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
the middle are the teenagers that

181
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
divide, make lots of noise. And um then

182
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,560
at the right are the the adult blood

183
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,800
cells that go to work, do their jobs.

184
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
And just one one other point at this

185
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,120
point, there's a protein, a marker on

186
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,440
these cells called CD34. And you'll see

187
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,120
me refer to it several times. It's not

188
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,720
exclusively on the stem cells, but it's

189
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
on the stem cells. sort of the other

190
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,240
early cells. So a lot of times when

191
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,919
we're processing cells from a patient,

192
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,919
we'll select those that have that marker

193
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,479
just to enrich our targets.

194
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,560
And and so hematopotic stem cells or

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,120
bone transplant has been around for more

196
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
than 50 years and mostly it's done for

197
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
people with cancer leukemia. So stem

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,560
cells from those sources I talked about

199
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
bone marrow mobilized peripheralic cord

200
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,800
blood mainly it's for people with

201
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,120
leukemia that didn't respond to the

202
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,440
initial therapy and so we need to give

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
them higher doses which will basically

204
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,360
wipe out their marrow so then they get

205
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,560
the transplant as a rescue from that. So

206
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
treating high-risisk cancers and

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
leukemia by allowing higher doses of

208
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,240
chemotherapy that would otherwise be

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
possible hopefully to cure the leukemia

210
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,919
and using the stem cells basically as a

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,879
rescue. So that's probably 90 plus

212
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,080
percent of transplants that are done. A

213
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,000
small number are done when there's

214
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,000
marrow failure. So there's a condition

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
called alastic anemia where the bone

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,599
marrow stops working. Can also happen

217
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
after exposure to some drugs or

218
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,039
radiation. But we're interested in

219
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
number three. And it can be used to

220
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,719
treat genetic diseases. basically if

221
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,800
they're of blood cells or blood related

222
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,039
cells by replacing the patient's

223
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
genetically deficient cells with normal

224
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,800
cells either from a donor or in our case

225
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
taking the patient's own cells and

226
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,519
making them normal by adding the gene

227
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,000
that they're missing.

228
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,760
And this approach has been shown to cure

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,680
a number of diseases. And so um on the

230
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,440
right there might be a little smaller

231
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,120
are just a whole list of various

232
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
diseases sort of next to the cell type

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,880
they're involved with um where

234
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,880
transplants have been done in patients

235
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,959
and shown to be curative. And so by

236
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,480
giving them a normal stem cell they can

237
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,399
make the red cells they need that for

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,120
example for cickle cell disease or the

239
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,120
immune cells for skid and you know on

240
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,720
that list in in yellow is angelmen with

241
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,440
a question mark so we don't know if

242
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,000
it'll work but other diseases in that

243
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,480
group X linked adrenal lucadistrophe

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,720
metacchromatic lucadistrophe the the

245
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,440
mucopolyaccharidosis hurlers hunters

246
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,240
MPS3 all those have been treated

247
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,320
successfully by giving bone marrow and

248
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
some of those bone marrow stem cells

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,080
monocytes that go into the brain that

250
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,640
provide the missing enzyme. And that's

251
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:49,560
the that's the supposed mechanism by

252
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,560
which angel would would um respond.

253
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,560
And and so the major barrier from

254
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,720
transplanting cells from one person to

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,640
another are the immune system. Unless

256
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
you're going between identical twins,

257
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
there are going to be differences that

258
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,040
are detected by the immune system. So in

259
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,120
a healthy patient the normal patients

260
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,120
the recipients te- cells can reject the

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,040
donor cells unless they get high dose

262
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,920
chemotherapy and immune suppression

263
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,320
beforehand. But also the flip side can

264
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,760
occur some of the donor's te- cells that

265
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
come along with the bone marrow or the

266
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,279
mobilized peripheral blood in the new

267
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,640
body they're in can see it as foreign

268
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,480
and react against it. That's called

269
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
graph versus host disease. So the

270
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
grafted cells are attacking their new

271
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,519
host thinking they're just trying to get

272
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,959
rid of something foreign. And as a

273
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,720
clinical transpler, that's what we spend

274
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,519
a lot of our time dealing with that

275
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,240
complication. It's won't happen from an

276
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,160
identical twin. It's possible with a

277
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
matched brother or sister who's a sort

278
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,760
of a a full match. They're still not

279
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:47,920
identical. And higher if you go to a

280
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,000
parent or an unrelated donor.

281
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,240
And and so then just sort of to step

282
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,800
back and put into perspective what we're

283
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,800
talking about gene therapy overall is an

284
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,279
area that over the last 30 40 years has

285
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
developed as a way of treating genetic

286
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,279
diseases and sort of can the world can

287
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
be divided into Xvivo which what we'll

288
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,839
talk about or invivo. Invivo is where

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,079
you put the missing gene right into the

290
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,640
body directly. That's often done with

291
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,560
AAV vectors that we've heard about. Um

292
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,279
or you can put in editing reagents like

293
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,120
crisper or you can put an ASO is to me

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,800
sort of a type of gene therapy where

295
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,720
you're manipulating the genes by putting

296
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,640
something directly into the body. And

297
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
for example, the first approved gene

298
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,959
therapy in the in the US was for an eye

299
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,360
disease where they put a virus carrying

300
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,920
a gene missing in a in the cells in the

301
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
back of the retina to restore vision.

302
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,920
And this has been looked at and there

303
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,680
are are drugs for musculardrophe going

304
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,000
into the brain um into the liver cells.

305
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,399
Um and the other half of the universe is

306
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,240
Xvivo where you take the cells out

307
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,920
manipulate them in the laboratory and

308
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
then return them. So we can really only

309
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,800
do that with the blood cells, the

310
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,959
hematopotic stem cells and TE-C cells.

311
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
And then sort of the hot new delivery

312
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
method that's being looked at are lipid

313
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,680
nano particles. So the same sort of

314
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
material that's used to deliver the

315
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
COVID vaccine can be targeted to be

316
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,480
given like as an injection and go to a

317
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
specific tissue and for example release

318
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,079
crisper editing reagents.

319
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,240
And so we're going to talk about

320
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,760
hematopotic stem cells as a target. But

321
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,760
just sort of put it in perspective of

322
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,079
where that f fits in the whole field of

323
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,320
gene therapy. And then just one other

324
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,920
comment is that all these gene therapies

325
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,240
we're talking about are to manipulate

326
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,560
the patient's body cells, the sematic

327
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,160
cells, but not the germ line. We don't

328
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,160
want what we're doing to get into the

329
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,240
human gene pool. We're not smart enough

330
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,399
yet to to do that. And so part of

331
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,720
getting reviewed and approved by the FDA

332
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,639
is to demonstrate if you're doing invivo

333
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,079
that you will not get into the germ line

334
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,680
and have that be sort of a permanent

335
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:48,240
change that could get passed along.

336
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,320
And so sort of the hypothesis for for

337
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,160
this is that gene therapy using

338
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,639
autotogus or the patient's own

339
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
hematopotic stem cells provides a donor

340
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
for every patient themselves. So you

341
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
don't have to look for a donor and it

342
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,839
will completely eliminate those risks of

343
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,360
graph versus host disease. And it also

344
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,639
then makes the transplant easier. You

345
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
don't need to immune suppress the

346
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
patient before the transplant to prevent

347
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,120
rejection or afterwards to control graph

348
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,800
versus host disease. But as we've

349
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,959
learned, you do do need to make some

350
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,560
space in the marrow for the cells to

351
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,079
engraft. And that's done that's called

352
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,200
conditioning. And I'll I'll talk about

353
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,279
that because that's kind of one of the

354
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,440
the biggest issues involved.

355
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,519
And so from an engineering standpoint,

356
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,519
the technical challenge is to get the

357
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,760
normal gene into that long-term stem

358
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,519
cells because those last a lifetime and

359
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,440
can be transplanted and will last a

360
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,680
lifetime in the patient that gets it.

361
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,920
All the other cells to to your right of

362
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,839
that are sort of short-term cells and

363
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,360
will last weeks or months, but won't be

364
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
permanent. So a lot of the early

365
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,519
learning in the field is what are those

366
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,320
stem cells and how do we manipulate

367
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,399
them? And the way we do it are either

368
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,279
adding a gene like with a virus that

369
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,199
I'll talk about today or now we can also

370
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,120
edit the genes in the stem cell with

371
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,720
things like crisper where we can fix a

372
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,880
mutation and then it will be passed

373
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,800
along to all the blood cells that'll be

374
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,959
made. It's estimated that each stem cell

375
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,360
once it starts dividing makes literally

376
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,440
billions of other blood cells and if you

377
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,040
get the gene in it permanently that will

378
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,120
get passed along to all the cells that

379
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,120
are made.

380
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,639
And and so just a little about the gene

381
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,880
delivery tool that we're using or

382
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,720
vector. So for stem cells that are going

383
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,199
to divide, you really need to get the

384
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,040
gene to go into the DNA of the target

385
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,639
cell. So it gets copied every time the

386
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,680
cell makes a new copy and gets passed

387
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,079
along. So AAV does not do that. And so

388
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
AV although it's efficient delivery, it

389
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,199
doesn't get into the DNA and so it would

390
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,199
get diluted out once the cells start

391
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,279
dividing. And so we've mainly used a

392
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,360
class of viruses called retroviruses.

393
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,760
and one of their submembers called a

394
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,399
lentivirus. So in the laboratory we

395
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,480
clone the needed gene into the virus

396
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,079
packaged into a viral capsid and then

397
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,240
added to the cell. So that sort of arc

398
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,399
is the membrane of the cell. Then the

399
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,040
the genotic genetic information in the

400
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,560
virus gets copied into DNA and goes into

401
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,920
the chromosome and integrates

402
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
permanently. So it becomes just part of

403
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,360
the double helix. You've got this little

404
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
gene unit that you've added and for

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,279
example it could be UB3A expressing that

406
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,680
gene. So in fact there's UB3A going into

407
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,959
the DNA. And so this technology was

408
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,360
developed sort of in the middle 80s

409
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,040
about I just shame to say when I came

410
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
into the field and it's really been

411
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
developed to a point where it's really

412
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,959
very quite efficient now at modifying

413
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,480
stem cells.

414
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,720
And so this is again sort of another

415
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,800
cartoon of of the process. So we start

416
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
with the patient, we collect their stem

417
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,480
cells and then in the laboratory we can

418
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,560
add a gene from the top with an

419
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
integrating virus that will go into the

420
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,800
DNA of the cell and be there permanently

421
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,600
or coming up from the bottom we can edit

422
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,279
the cells now with crisper. uh crisper

423
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,320
is generally better for sort of fixing

424
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,959
single mutations but adding a gene will

425
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,600
fix any will override any mutation in

426
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,160
that gene and then before the cells go

427
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,399
back in um they the patients will get

428
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,240
some conditioning chemotherapy to make

429
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,639
space in their marrow so we give the

430
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,199
cells back they they they can land and

431
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
grow and I'll show you cartoon of that

432
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,320
and then the cells are given back to the

433
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
patient and the transplant is actually

434
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,399
the easiest part it's not a surgery it's

435
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,040
just an infusion of cells like a like a

436
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,440
blood transfusion.

437
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,920
And so this is showing a person giving

438
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,199
mobilized peripheral blood. So they get

439
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,440
a growth factor GCSF nupagen that makes

440
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,199
the white cell count go up. Turns out it

441
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,279
also causes the stem cells to leave the

442
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,920
bone marrow and go into the bloodstream.

443
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,279
So after five days of GCSF sort of

444
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,519
boosted on the last day with another

445
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,600
medicine purify

446
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,040
stem cells in the circulation. So all we

447
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,480
need to do is collect blood from the

448
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,639
patient. So this process called

449
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,639
lucaparesis, some of the patients blood

450
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,320
goes out through an IV line, goes into

451
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,160
that centrifuge that collects the stem

452
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
cells, then everything else goes back to

453
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,320
the patient. So over the course of about

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
3 four hours, we've taken their entire

455
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,240
blood product, blood volume through the

456
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,000
machine two or three or four times and

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
skimmed off all the stem cells, but

458
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
returned everything else to them. So

459
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
when they're done, they they still

460
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,319
should have all their other blood cells

461
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,839
and not really have a problem from it.

462
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,360
So this is done usually in a clinical

463
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,360
setting. for kids, we bring them into

464
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,959
the hospital and do it um in the

465
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,199
hospital. And then you get what's shown

466
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,120
in the bottom right, a bag of basically

467
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,600
white blood cells that are very enriched

468
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,600
for stem cells.

469
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,520
And so then this is showing the

470
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,679
processing. So upper left is the patient

471
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,520
getting lucaper in the unit. Then they

472
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,679
go to what we call GMP or good

473
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,679
manufacturing practice lab. That's the

474
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,919
ultra clean room like where you can make

475
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,600
um computer chips or we're making cells

476
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,679
for patients. So we don't want any risk

477
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
of contaminating their cells with you

478
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,440
know the the bacteria that are on the on

479
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,960
the workers. So everyone's gowned and

480
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,120
gloved and masked and the air is ultra

481
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
filtered etc. The stem cells are brought

482
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,520
there. They're processed to isolate the

483
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,440
CD34 enriching for the stem cells and

484
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
they're cultured for two days typically

485
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,679
to add the virus with the with the

486
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,320
missing gene and you know one day that

487
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,679
will be UB3A and then we freeze the

488
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,919
cells. So they're only in culture for

489
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,080
two days. We freeze them down and

490
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,919
besides the main bag of the cells, we

491
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,760
have several vials of the same material

492
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
that we can then thaw to test to make

493
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,520
sure every cell took up the gene that

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,520
it's sterile. So, we have a whole list

495
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,679
of criteria that are are listed there.

496
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,440
And the cells have to pass 100% of their

497
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,880
criteria to be able to be used and

498
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
they're released by the quality

499
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,440
assurance unit of the GMP. Um, and then

500
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,799
they're ready for the patient and then

501
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,919
they're just infused as shown there

502
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,919
through an IV.

503
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,720
And so the elephant in the room I think

504
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,760
in in transplant is conditioning as we

505
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,840
refer to it. And so conditioning is

506
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
where we give chemotherapy to make

507
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
space. And in different types of

508
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,280
transplants we'd either sort of give

509
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,760
full condition where we really try and

510
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:51,600
wipe out basically all the bone marrow.

511
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
So all the cells that grow afterwards

512
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,360
come from what you gave back or in some

513
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,840
cases like skid we only need to do that

514
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,120
partially or in some cases we don't do

515
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:04,640
that at all. So here's my Los Angeles

516
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,559
sporting college team analogy. So if

517
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,360
your marrow is filled with all these USC

518
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:11,360
footballs and then um you either you

519
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,520
give no conditioning, full conditioning

520
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
or reduced intensity, that's kind of

521
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,960
what you have afterwards. So if you give

522
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,600
no conditioning, there's very little

523
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,960
space in the stem cell niche. If you

524
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,720
give give full conditioning, you've

525
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
really opened things up for cells to

526
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,520
engraft. And if you give sort of an

527
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
intermediate amount, you open up some

528
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,559
space. And now we give the UCLA

529
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,080
basketball stem cells.

530
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,840
And so with no conditioning, there's

531
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,760
very little engraftment of the cells.

532
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,080
And we actually had a trial in the early

533
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,919
2000s where we started out not giving

534
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,600
conditioning. We didn't get engraftment.

535
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
We then this is again for skid patients

536
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,039
that we started giving conditioning and

537
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,640
everyone engrafted. So in that study, we

538
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,720
kind of proved at least in that setting,

539
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,720
it's essential to make some space. And

540
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
if you fully abladed the marrow with

541
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,160
highdose chemotherapy, then you

542
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,840
basically it's taken over completely by

543
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,960
the cells you've given back. And that's

544
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,919
what I think we'd want to do for

545
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,799
Angelmen.

546
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,039
But this this is again the probably the

547
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,720
most difficult part of a transplant, the

548
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,240
conditioning. So the conditioning

549
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
currently used prior to infusion of the

550
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,799
gene modified cells is a chemotherapy

551
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,320
drug called buculan. And it's given over

552
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,160
three to four days before the transplant

553
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,320
only. So it's not like multiple courses

554
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,880
of chemotherapy. It's just four days of

555
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,799
getting this drug twice a day typically.

556
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,960
And that will completely wipe out the

557
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,559
bone marrow stem cells. And actually the

558
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,600
patients are usually okay the days

559
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,799
they're getting it. So it's kind of

560
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
different than if any of you have

561
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,000
experience with a relative getting

562
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
chemotherapy. It's really over the next

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,880
few weeks that they they will have the

564
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,720
effects of that. So some of those

565
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,320
effects are are listed there. So they

566
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
may get a condition called mucousitis

567
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,400
where the mucous membranes of the mouth

568
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,480
are irritated because they're a dividing

569
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,120
cell. So the chemotherapy hits them. And

570
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,480
so often the patients for a week or two

571
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,240
won't really be able to eat and we'll

572
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,240
need to get introvenous feeding might

573
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,559
need pain medicines. So that's kind of

574
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,320
again the the hardest part of it but

575
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,320
people get through that but it's it's

576
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,760
challenging and and certainly may be

577
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,080
more challenging in patients with

578
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,000
Angelmen. Um typically from that amount

579
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,640
of chemotherapy the hair will fall out

580
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,919
in a week or two but it comes back. Uh

581
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,559
but you know again for some patients

582
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,000
that's very upsetting obviously. Um

583
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,440
there may be nausea and vomiting

584
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,039
although we really have very good drugs

585
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,159
now to control that. So usually there

586
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,480
isn't a lot of that. Um rarely the drug

587
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,440
can cause liver damage. mainly we see it

588
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
in people who've had a lot of

589
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,320
chemotherapy before like for leukemia.

590
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Um and one of the other side effects

591
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,159
that may cause infertility because the

592
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,679
egg forming cells and the sperm forming

593
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,919
cells are also sensitive to the

594
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,840
chemotherapy. And so there are ways in

595
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:41,039
advance to preserve egg or sperm for um

596
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,880
future use if if interested. Um and then

597
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,280
there's hypothetically low risks of late

598
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,960
cancer or lung problems. We haven't seen

599
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,000
that really very commonly, but that

600
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,000
that's it's it's at least a risk. Uh and

601
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
so that's again, you know, I think it's

602
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,440
important to really address that because

603
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,880
that's the hardest part of a of a

604
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,720
transplant. So that means getting your

605
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,320
child through a couple of weeks which

606
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,559
they're they're not very happy. They

607
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,159
need medicines. They need introvenous

608
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,720
feeding, meaning they'll need to have an

609
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,080
introvenous line that whole time.

610
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,480
There are a lot of new things coming

611
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,559
along, ways to replace the chemotherapy

612
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,559
with antibodies to stem cells to

613
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,640
eliminate them without really those kind

614
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,280
of complications. They're not quite

615
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,559
there yet. There there's it's promising.

616
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,919
Then there's also sort of the the

617
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,880
challenge of getting it commercially

618
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,240
approved. So I think in five years or so

619
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,240
maybe we'll be able to stop using

620
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,240
chemotherapy.

621
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,039
Uh so then just sort of more about the

622
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,039
transplant. So on your left that's nurse

623
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,559
Lindsay bringing Ava's transplant

624
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,000
bucket. So every child before their

625
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,760
transplant, we fill up a buck with all

626
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,320
the tubes and connectors and everything

627
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,400
they might need. In the middle is that

628
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,320
tank that looks sort of like R2-D2.

629
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,640
That's a liquid nitrogen transport tank

630
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,400
that has the stem cell in there. And

631
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
then on the right is the thawed stem

632
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,240
cell bag. And so you can kind of see

633
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
there's an air fluid level. So the

634
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,919
little bit of cloudiness below that,

635
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,960
that's the stem cell graft. So that

636
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:03,520
might be a 100 million or 200 million

637
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,280
stem cells. and that will be enough to

638
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,559
repopulate their bone marrow and make

639
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,400
their blood cells for the rest of their

640
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,440
life. So that's kind of the most amazing

641
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,520
part I think. And so here's a here's a

642
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,960
patient who had skid getting his

643
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,400
transplant. And so on the left you can

644
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,320
see that syringe is kind of cloudy.

645
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,000
Again, those are his stem cell graft.

646
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,919
The tube on the right is just the saline

647
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,679
flush. So those cells are just over five

648
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,440
or 10 minutes. They're slowly pushed in

649
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,360
through their IV line. They get into the

650
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,720
body. they they go through the body and

651
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,919
they'll make their way to the bone

652
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,919
marrow and stick and start growing.

653
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,440
So that's sort of the that's sort of the

654
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,880
background on stem cell transplant. Um

655
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,400
and so now I want to talk about our

656
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,559
experience with severe commit immune

657
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,679
deficiency to show you what what can be

658
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,840
done and what what the results can be.

659
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,080
So this is a a famous child for those of

660
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,240
you who are of my generation. This is

661
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,600
David Veter, the boy in the bubble. So

662
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,320
this was a young man who was born in

663
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,240
Houston, Texas in the early 70s. His

664
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,720
younger brother had just died of the

665
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,039
recently described disease called Skid.

666
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,760
So at birth he was put into isolation,

667
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,679
tested and found to have it. And he he

668
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,200
was tested and his one sister was not a

669
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
match. So there wasn't a way to

670
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,679
transplant him. So he was kept in a

671
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,279
sterile environment for 13 years. So it

672
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,039
was very much in the media because

673
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:23,200
what's mankind country that were keeping

674
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,880
people in bubbles and eventually he had

675
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,159
a transplant from his sister and died of

676
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,520
complications at 13. Um and he had that

677
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,440
disease severe combined immune

678
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,600
deficiency.

679
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,960
And so we've worked on this disease

680
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,360
again since I've been working on it

681
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,240
since the mid 80s. Um and this is the

682
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,600
work since I've been at UCLA of over

683
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,200
time all the patients we've

684
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,840
transplanted. So we've done multiple

685
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,480
trials iteratively trying sort of

686
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,080
version 1.0 0 seeing what worked, what

687
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,159
didn't work, coming back with version

688
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,320
2.0, and we're sort of currently in

689
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,720
version 3.0, which is on your right,

690
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
which is using a lentiviral vector. So,

691
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,080
lentiviral vectors are what are mainly

692
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,480
used now for putting genes permanently

693
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,080
into hematopotic stem cells. And it

694
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,559
needs to be said they're derived from

695
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,559
the HIV virus. That's lenti is the class

696
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,799
of viruses that belongs to. All the

697
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,799
virus genes are removed and replaced by

698
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:14,480
the gene to be carried. and they've

699
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,720
never caused a problem like causing

700
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,559
immune deficiency like like AIDS, but

701
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,400
they're actually very well adapted at

702
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,440
getting into human cells. So, we've done

703
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,679
a number of trials with that that virus

704
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,200
that I'll tell you about. So, that's the

705
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,960
map of the virus. So, let me kind of

706
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,159
walk you through it. So, in the middle

707
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,320
is the human ADA gene and we've tweaked

708
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,559
it. We've cod and optimized it. So there

709
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,679
are different letter combinations like a

710
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,400
AAA and a AAU and AAC that code for the

711
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,400
same amino acid bey put into the protein

712
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,919
and cells have favorites and so if you

713
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
change the sequence to have the

714
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,600
favorites you make the same protein but

715
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,400
you make it more efficiently. So it's

716
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,000
coden optimized ADA sequence and then

717
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,520
the promoter in front of it that as we

718
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,520
heard yesterday from that great talk by

719
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,679
Dr. James is sort of the control unit

720
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,640
that drives it is from a cellular gene

721
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,320
called elong elongation factor short.

722
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,080
So, it's a promoter that will drive

723
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:08,320
production of a gene, but it can't

724
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,159
interfere with nearby genes. And as I'll

725
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,320
show you, we we have a great deal of

726
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,919
safety data. And so, we actually

727
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
developed this jointly with colleagues

728
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,640
in in London. And so, over the last

729
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,120
decade, we've done trials in parallel,

730
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,360
same batches of vector, same protocol.

731
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,600
And um I'll show you as of now, we we've

732
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,600
reported 62 patients treated. This was a

733
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:31,360
little earlier when we did trials both

734
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,039
in in London and at Los Angeles.

735
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,279
So this is sort of the the patient

736
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,080
journey through the gene therapy. So the

737
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,799
first part is talking to the family

738
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,799
discussing risks alternatives etc. And

739
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,799
if they agree having them sign the

740
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,159
informed consent then having screening

741
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:49,200
tests just to make sure they meet the

742
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,799
criteria and it's things like echo EKG

743
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,320
blood tests to just to make sure they're

744
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,320
they're healthy enough to go through the

745
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,320
transplant. If they are then they then

746
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,559
come into the hospital for the stem cell

747
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,880
collection. So they'll get injections

748
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,760
five days in a row of GCSF. They'll get

749
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,039
a dose of that drug puriferesis

750
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,520
for one or two days to collect their

751
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,919
stem cells. Then they go home the next

752
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,200
day. The cells go to the laboratory for

753
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,760
doing the kind of processing I talked

754
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,679
about. So we isolate the CD34 cells. We

755
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,919
add the lentiviral vector with the

756
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,520
normal ADA gene and freeze them down to

757
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,600
cryopreserve them. And then it takes

758
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,880
about a month or so to test them to make

759
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,880
sure they meet all those criteria. I

760
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,559
talked about sterility took up the gene

761
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
etc. And then when we know that the

762
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,279
cells are are good and they're signed

763
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,880
off by the QA unit, the patient comes

764
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
back for the second admission. And this

765
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,720
is the transplant admission. So they'll

766
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,360
come into the hospital, they'll get a a

767
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,360
central line placed, either a long IV

768
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,279
line, a pick line in their elbow or

769
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,279
actually a surgically placed central

770
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,840
line that can stay in for months are are

771
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,400
quite secure although I have seen once

772
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,679
two kids pull them out. And then they'll

773
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,320
starting that day, we'll give them their

774
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,880
their chemotherapy. So showing bulfin on

775
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,039
Monday and it turns out that the

776
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
metabolism of bulfin differs a lot

777
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,799
person to person. So we actually

778
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,279
personalize it. We measure how quickly

779
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,360
the person cleared that first dose and

780
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,679
we adjust their later doses to try and

781
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,520
total um area under the curve or

782
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,360
exposure to the drug. And so we've

783
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,399
gotten much better at at targeting it

784
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,320
precisely. And then um on Friday, so it

785
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,679
start on Monday. On Friday they get

786
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,760
their cells. So again we bring the cells

787
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,600
to the bedside we thaw them. We infuse

788
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,440
them. and they're kind of done with the

789
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
transplant and hopefully it it will have

790
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,120
an effect, but then they have that few

791
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,679
weeks afterward from the side effects of

792
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,039
the chemotherapy.

793
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,480
And this was the frozen trial. This is

794
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,039
the first time we did frozen cells. We

795
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,080
call it the frozen trial.

796
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,480
And so we've done this now for um around

797
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,000
50 more than 50 or 60 patients with with

798
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,080
this antiviral vector. We did some

799
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,320
earlier ones and this is just a map of

800
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,760
where they came from. So rare diseases

801
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,760
like this, the patients are not all in

802
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,080
Los Angeles. So they're all over and we

803
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,600
basically had patients from the US and

804
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,520
Canada. So I actually got better at

805
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,679
relearning my Canadian geographies I

806
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,120
learned in third or fourth grade. Uh so

807
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,399
there's arrows from the different trials

808
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,240
showing where the patients came from.

809
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,240
And so you we would bring the families

810
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,760
out to Los Angeles for the stem cell

811
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,120
collection they would go home. They

812
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,640
would come back for the collection and

813
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,320
while they're there we'd have the

814
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,039
patient stay at Ronald McDonald House or

815
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,720
a hotel like that. And uh usually in our

816
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,240
transplant unit one patient can sleep

817
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,039
one parent can sleep in the room

818
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,279
overnight.

819
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:25,600
And so we reported our results. Uh this

820
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,799
is now four years ago. This was a report

821
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,960
of 50 patients, 30 treated by UCLA, 30

822
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,120
at Great Orman Street Hospital in London

823
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,799
with this approach that I talked about

824
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,600
using CD34 cells that lentiviral vector

825
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,840
lower dose bulfan. And what we reported

826
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,159
was 100% of the patients were alive and

827
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,960
well and they still are to the present

828
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:50,000
time. And 96% of them were event-free

829
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,760
survival. So we define an event sort of

830
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,840
it failed and they need to go back and

831
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,679
have a transplant. And so we had four we

832
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,760
had two patients the initial group where

833
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,600
the cells just didn't grow and they

834
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,600
needed to go back on the enzyme and then

835
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,760
then have a they had a transplant later.

836
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,520
Uh and then so we just had another paper

837
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
come out two weeks ago sort of following

838
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,080
that cohort plus another 12 that were

839
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,880
done in London sort of a year later. And

840
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,960
so in this paper we reported 62 patients

841
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,080
with ADA skid treated again at UCLA and

842
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,760
Gosh between 2012 and 2018. So now we're

843
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,240
reporting how do they look a decade out

844
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,720
basically. So what the time we analyze

845
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,600
the data was 2023. So actually they're

846
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,039
two years beyond that point now. And

847
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,600
what we're able to report was that it

848
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,679
was completely persistent and stable. So

849
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,360
all the patients had stable. We measure

850
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,279
the the gene and the blood cells in the

851
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,159
circulation. We measure their te- cell

852
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,640
numbers etc. no change after the first

853
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,279
six months or so and really quite quite

854
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,039
good. They had good immunity. There were

855
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,799
no complications from the gene therapy

856
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,279
or from the vector in any of our

857
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,559
patients.

858
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,320
And then this is just one graph. It's

859
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,000
kind of small, but just shows different

860
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,559
T- cell populations that we measured

861
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,799
over time are all stable out to 10 to 12

862
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,720
years. And so we we hope this will be

863
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,240
stable for their lifetime. We don't know

864
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,000
that yet till we follow them for their

865
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,840
lifetime, but it really looks like this

866
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,200
is persisting. And so that's, you know,

867
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,200
that's obviously very important to have

868
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,880
a long-term effect. So the stem cells

869
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,360
that we took out of the body, put the

870
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,520
gene into, put back are still now in the

871
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:24,159
bone marrow making blood cells.

872
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,640
And in fact, at least 18 different blood

873
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,080
cell diseases or genetic diseases have

874
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,399
been treated by this approach. So this

875
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,080
is a list that I sort of keep myself of

876
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,919
all the diseases that have been reported

877
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,679
in clinical trials or at meetings

878
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,519
treated by this approach of lentiviral

879
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,679
vectors putting the missing gene into

880
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,080
hematopetic stem cells. And so on the

881
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,919
list the top two on the left are genes I

882
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,840
mentioned before adrenolucadistrophe and

883
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,240
metacromatic lucodistrophe which are

884
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,399
neurodeenerative disorders. And by

885
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,399
giving them gene corrected bone marrow

886
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,840
and getting cells going into the brain

887
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,080
they make the missing enzyme and really

888
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,200
stop the neurodeeneration. and the on

889
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:01,440
the top right MPS one and three are also

890
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,600
similar uh diseases like that have been

891
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,279
treated and so angelin has not been

892
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,000
treated by a bone marrow transmitter by

893
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,080
gene therapy yet but if it follows the

894
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,399
rules that these other diseases did it

895
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,919
should be beneficial so in all these

896
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,240
trials lentiviral vectors have had an

897
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,720
excellent safety profile one exception

898
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,720
being actually an ALD and Allison

899
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,120
referred to this that virus they used

900
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,000
had a mouse retrovirus element driving

901
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,760
the gene and those can cause a problem

902
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,279
and coming soon we're working on

903
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,720
alphathalmia but we're also working on

904
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,720
angelman syndrome and hopefully they

905
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,799
will be on this list in a few years as

906
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,240
having been successfully treated. So let

907
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,360
me talk now about how this would apply

908
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,960
to Angelman syndrome.

909
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,880
And so this is another view of the

910
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,880
hematopotic stem cells making blood

911
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,039
cells. And the important thing is on the

912
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,720
left one of the blood cells that's made

913
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,799
are monocytes. And monocytes are cells

914
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,799
that become mainly become macroofagages

915
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,799
or big eaters and they're in tissues.

916
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:58,799
They're in the blood. Some subset of

917
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,360
those monocytes cross the bloodb brain

918
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,600
barrier and turn into microgallike

919
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,440
cells. The afficionados don't allow us

920
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,360
to call them true microglea because

921
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,880
those only happen in the embryo, but

922
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,240
they functionally are microgal cells.

923
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,919
And then this is sort of a little more

924
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,200
complicated version. So on your lower

925
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,840
right shows that in uterero cells from

926
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,519
the bone marrow go into the brain and

927
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,000
form the micro gal cells that you're

928
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,080
born with. But post-natally after you're

929
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
born, cells from the bone marrow can

930
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,840
make monocytes that can go across the

931
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,679
brain and make microgallike cells. And

932
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,600
that's accelerated by a bone marrow

933
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,080
transplant. And in fact, the bulfan

934
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,320
besides increasing engraftment into the

935
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,919
bone marrow also increase engraftment of

936
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,320
microgal cells into the brain.

937
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,840
Um and then the the other aspect of this

938
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,200
is cross correction. So the the UB3A

939
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,240
gene that was developed with by FAS with

940
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,399
um the group at Davis is designed to

941
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,480
actually have the protein be secreted

942
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,080
from the micro gal cells so it can be

943
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,000
taken up by the neurons. And I think

944
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,080
that's kind of this the secret sauce of

945
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,080
this. And so if you got these microgal

946
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,840
cells that came from the stem cells with

947
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,839
the gene, they actually can release the

948
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,000
protein and cure the neurons around

949
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,079
them.

950
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,919
And so uh actually Colin showed a

951
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,440
version of this yesterday where the

952
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,359
procedure then is collecting the stem

953
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,760
cells from the patient adding the virus

954
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:23,599
with the UB3A gene transplanting them

955
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:28,760
back in and over time they will then

956
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,760
make microgle cells in in the brain.

957
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,879
And so this is a slide from the work

958
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,159
done at at UC Davis and they they really

959
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,960
pioneered this work and we're kind of

960
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,879
really riding in their wake. So they

961
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,240
made a lentiviral vector and this was

962
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,040
the one made from mouse. It has the

963
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,280
mouse UB3A gene and it uses that

964
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,200
retroviral promoter to drive expression

965
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,359
of the gene. So it's it's very strong

966
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,599
and make a lot of the product and they

967
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,240
did very nice work in the mouse model

968
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,400
again as Allison said curing all aspects

969
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,800
behavioral that's the the graph on the

970
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,800
bottom right is uh delta power showing

971
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,640
that it's hard to read but the the delta

972
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,560
power in the transplanted mice was as

973
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,440
good as in the neurotypic wild type

974
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,359
mice. But the problem was the promoter

975
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,200
element they used is the one that was

976
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:16,560
shown sort of about as this work was

977
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,359
being done in ALD to have risks of

978
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,240
triggering leukemia.

979
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,119
And so um and this is a paper describing

980
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,359
the ALD studies where patients were

981
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,599
cured of their disease by the gene

982
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:31,280
therapy but over time an increasing

983
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:32,960
numbers of them developed sort of an

984
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,720
early pre-lukemia and some of it went

985
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,839
out to leukemia because that viral

986
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,520
element turned on cellular growth genes

987
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:41,520
and that's kind of been known as a risk

988
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,000
and so most of the field has moved away

989
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,480
from from using that um and instead

990
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,800
using like we use for the ADA that that

991
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,800
has a very good safety record. So our

992
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,720
primary goal when when Allison first

993
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,280
came to us was to make a vector that

994
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,119
would work as well as the other one but

995
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,200
that was safer that would have control

996
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,920
elements that wouldn't risk turning on

997
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,599
genes near where they land

998
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,599
and then ultimately that comes to now

999
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,680
translating this to a clinical trial of

1000
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,280
gene therapy

1001
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,599
and so the work that I'm going to

1002
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,359
present now was done by Roger Hollis is

1003
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,680
the lead scientist Christopher Luther's

1004
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,640
who spoke here last year and who is

1005
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,160
amazing um started work and then Colin

1006
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,480
Jwitt who spoke yesterday has been

1007
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,400
carrying it on since since Chris off

1008
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,160
Chris Chris finished his PhD and is at

1009
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,160
the CDC to become an epidemiologic

1010
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,000
intelligence service officer which will

1011
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,960
be great for the world but we we miss

1012
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,240
him and so they made a series of

1013
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,720
lentiviral vectors that have the UB3A

1014
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,880
gene in them and use different promoters

1015
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,480
so we made one like the Davis one with

1016
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,480
the M &D promoter as our sort of

1017
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,040
comparator or then we used one with an

1018
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,119
EFS promoter that's in our ADA vector or

1019
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,880
another promoter or PGK that's also been

1020
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,640
used in a number of clinical trials and

1021
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,480
been shown to be safe. And so our

1022
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,440
question was can we make one that will

1023
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,160
work as well as the M &D1 with a with a

1024
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,920
better safety profile.

1025
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,880
And so this is a western blot showing

1026
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,960
the level of expression of UB3A protein

1027
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,960
are those bands and the two on your left

1028
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,800
are our new modified vectors. And again,

1029
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,119
we did that trick of codon optimizing

1030
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,480
the gene. So it makes more protein. And

1031
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,640
by doing that, we're actually making

1032
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,480
more copies of the pro more amount of

1033
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,800
the protein than the one with just the M

1034
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,640
andd promoter driving the wild type

1035
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,320
gene.

1036
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,240
And so then we went out to do a number

1037
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,119
of studies again following what Davis

1038
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,520
had done and guided a lot by Allison and

1039
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,280
Jennifer on these studies taking these

1040
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,200
different vectors putting them into the

1041
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,880
mouse model and then doing behavioral

1042
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,760
and EEG and uh histoemical studies and

1043
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,359
I'll just show you a little of it

1044
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,359
because again Colin presented this

1045
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,880
yesterday. So we used either the EFS

1046
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,480
driven promoter the PGK or we didn't

1047
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,240
modify the cells we just mock

1048
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,640
transplanted cells that still were not

1049
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,800
corrected or we took bone marrow from

1050
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,760
wild type neurotypic mice or from the

1051
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,680
angel mice. We had five groups of mice.

1052
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,839
This graph is just showing the level of

1053
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,720
engraftment. The panel on the left we

1054
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:06,560
actually always used male donors into

1055
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,400
females. So we could measure how much

1056
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,560
cells are engrafted by measuring the Y

1057
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,119
chromosome for the male cells. And so

1058
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:18,800
the the the groups at the top uh were

1059
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:21,280
the ones that um in in the blood are um

1060
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:26,560
uh in are the two different vectors PGK

1061
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,160
and E EGFP and sorry EFS and PGK. So the

1062
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,079
the bands in the middle are in the blood

1063
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,320
and the bone marrow. So we have 80 90%

1064
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,079
engraftment of the donor cells. And then

1065
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,400
the lower left of that panel are

1066
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,640
measuring the male cells in the brain.

1067
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,160
And so they're there. about 100fold

1068
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,400
lower, but that's because most of the

1069
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,839
brain has other cells in it. And then on

1070
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,280
the right is measuring the vector copy

1071
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,280
numbers where you have about one to two

1072
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,839
copies of the vector in the blood cells.

1073
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,800
And again, the brain lower, but still

1074
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,320
about a half a percent or so of cells

1075
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,720
with the the gene in the brain. And then

1076
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,240
we saw all the same kind of amazing uh

1077
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,000
behavioral improvements. So this is on

1078
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,000
the left, open field that measures sort

1079
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,560
of their mobility. And the lower two

1080
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,640
bands are the untreated angelman mice or

1081
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,640
those that got just angelman marrow. And

1082
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,800
the bands above it are the ones that got

1083
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,640
either the wild type marrow or with

1084
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,839
either of our vectors. The roto rod

1085
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,599
assay that we saw a nice video of

1086
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:19,760
yesterday shows that the mice that got

1087
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,839
gene therapy performed as well as the

1088
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,720
wild type mice in terms of their ability

1089
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,320
to stay on the the rotating rod. Um and

1090
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,760
then these are other measurements of

1091
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,320
cognitive function novel object

1092
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,720
recognition. And again, the gene therapy

1093
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,280
mice performed as well as the wild type

1094
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,680
mice as Davis had shown with with their

1095
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,960
vector.

1096
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,800
And then here and here's the EEGs.

1097
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,400
Um, and so sort of our conclusion from

1098
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,079
the mouse studies that again Chris

1099
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,760
presented last year when we were sort of

1100
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,359
mid-stream of those and now Colin has

1101
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,079
finished up and we have a paper that's

1102
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,000
under review. Both the EFS and the PGK

1103
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,240
driven vectors had improved expression

1104
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,320
over the potentially encoenic M andD

1105
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,839
vector. The treated mice showed improved

1106
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,760
motor and cognitive function during

1107
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,440
behavioral assays. The treated mouse

1108
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,359
delta powered measured by EEG was

1109
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,640
reduced to wild type levels. And the

1110
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:08,000
iminochemistry, which I didn't show,

1111
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,920
Allison actually showed some very nice

1112
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,160
pictures yesterday on the brain slices

1113
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,440
showed that the protein is being made in

1114
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,960
the brain. And we can actually see it in

1115
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,960
the neurons. So presumably it's leaving

1116
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:20,079
the micro gleal cells and being taken up

1117
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,640
by the nerve cells.

1118
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,800
And so you the question is you know mice

1119
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,720
are mice and can the excellent benefits

1120
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,560
that we see in the mouse models will

1121
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,680
that bear have any bearing on what we

1122
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,040
see in patients. Um and again the mice

1123
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,280
that we treated they were transplanted

1124
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,680
about 6 to 8 weeks of age which sort of

1125
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,760
like a late teenager in in human

1126
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,079
development. And so they weren't infant

1127
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,440
mice and so at least at that age uh

1128
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,040
there there was benefit that that

1129
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,800
persists. We've studied, we usually

1130
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,119
study them about four months later.

1131
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,640
And so with uh fast and with

1132
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,400
transformatics, we applied to the

1133
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,560
California Institute for Regenerative

1134
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,040
Medicine, our our stem cell uh funding

1135
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,960
agency in California for a grant to ter

1136
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,720
carry this forward. And so the grant is

1137
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,599
a trans one, which is a translational

1138
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,760
grant. Um and our goals are to start out

1139
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,359
by having the vector that we made in our

1140
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,040
laboratory made under commercial

1141
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,280
standards. So it would be suitable for

1142
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,680
human use. and that's going on right

1143
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,880
now. And then that same manufacturing

1144
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,119
company will be the one that will make

1145
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,800
the cells for the patients. Uh then we

1146
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,880
need to do various tests for safety. So

1147
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,160
put the cells into immune deficient mice

1148
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,160
for example and make sure they don't

1149
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,760
cause any complications. We'll need a

1150
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,520
clinical protocol which is drafted but

1151
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
we need to sort of finalize that the

1152
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,920
informed consent document for a trial

1153
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,319
and then we would meet with the FDA. And

1154
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,160
so to do a clinical trial any new

1155
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,520
substance, you need an investigational

1156
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,040
new drug or IND permit from FDA. And FDA

1157
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:45,200
is very helpful at letting you meet with

1158
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,640
them in advance. And so a preINDD

1159
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,560
meeting is when you meet with them and

1160
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,560
tell them what your plans are, show them

1161
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,640
the data you have so far and they will

1162
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,560
tell you is that enough or what else you

1163
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,640
need to do to apply for approval. And so

1164
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:58,480
we'll have a preINDD meeting. We'll do

1165
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,400
whatever studies additional they they

1166
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,560
want us to do and they would submit that

1167
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,640
application to the FDA to do a clinical

1168
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,079
trial. So the hope is to open up a trial

1169
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,079
for this within a few years.

1170
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,079
And so I'll just leave with some

1171
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,880
questions. You know, there there's a lot

1172
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:18,000
of unknowns obviously and as a physician

1173
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,079
and as a scientist I try and you know

1174
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,280
deal with reality and you know so I

1175
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,440
think there's a lot of things we we

1176
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,119
don't know. We we know it works well in

1177
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,520
mice but for example first of all will

1178
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,760
it be feasible for Angelment patients to

1179
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,160
undergo this procedure? it means about a

1180
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,359
month or more in the hospital with IV

1181
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,119
lines um and going through and getting

1182
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,960
recovering from the chemotherapy. So,

1183
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,040
it'll be a challenge for the patient and

1184
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,920
the families, but we we've done other

1185
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,160
people with um disabilities and gotten

1186
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,880
them through the transplants. Um will it

1187
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,960
be safe? Are there unique problems

1188
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,960
inherent to Angelmen that might get

1189
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,160
might make it more risky? And then

1190
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,520
ultimately, will it be effective at

1191
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,480
improving their clinical features?

1192
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,839
That's that's what we're hoping to see.

1193
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,440
So I will stop there and just show you

1194
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,800
this is my lab group as of last summer.

1195
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,720
So we have little army of people

1196
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,119
working. Colin's way in the back of the

1197
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,560
picture.

1198
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,560
And then this is our acknowledgement

1199
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,960
slide. So again the work at our lab

1200
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:14,960
Roger Hollis is leading it. Chris Luther

1201
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,400
did a lot of the initial work. Colin is

1202
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,240
finishing up with a number of other

1203
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,560
people assisting him. We've had a number

1204
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,920
of labs at UCLA that assisted us. And

1205
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,599
then we've done this very much as a

1206
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,800
partnership with FAST. And then we have

1207
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,319
the recent funding from SERM that

1208
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,640
hopefully will let us take this to the

1209
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,640
clinic. And I'll stop there. Thank you.

1210
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,319
Sorry about that. Thank you so much for

1211
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,440
such a great presentation and really

1212
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,119
really important work. Um obviously all

1213
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,160
individuals with Angelman syndrome are

1214
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,560
missing a functional copy of UB3A

1215
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,280
but as we heard yesterday many with the

1216
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,319
deletion genotype may also be missing um

1217
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,960
or hapo insufficient for many genes. If

1218
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,280
this is proven to work do you foresee a

1219
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,839
future where maybe individuals could

1220
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,560
receive an individualized set of genes

1221
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,960
for those that they're they're needing.

1222
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,800
>> Yeah. So it's as very hard to hear up

1223
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,720
here the the echo but I think the

1224
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,960
question was about would this work for

1225
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,000
people with deletion if if that's was

1226
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,440
that the main point of the question

1227
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,720
>> can the the other genes so yeah I don't

1228
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,520
know that and so this is my first time

1229
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:47,200
here so I I I that's a question

1230
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,680
obviously I've been thinking about a lot

1231
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,599
since being here and a question is

1232
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:54,480
should we start just with people with

1233
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,079
mutation um and then see that works we

1234
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,760
also need to get the mouse with the

1235
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,079
deletion and and test if you just

1236
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
replace the gene. If you need to replace

1237
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,920
the other ones, then you know you you

1238
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:06,240
could you could probably put two genes

1239
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,520
in the same vector, but if you need

1240
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,440
multiple genes, it might be more

1241
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,280
challenging. Uh there are techniques

1242
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,079
being developed to put larger pieces of

1243
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,680
DNA into cells and they work in the

1244
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,160
laboratory, but not very efficient for

1245
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,520
primary stem cells. So I'm not I'm not

1246
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,200
sure how how that would be approached.

1247
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,960
Um, and I, you know, hopefully the

1248
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,880
research will hone down what are the

1249
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,400
other critical ones in the deletion area

1250
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,119
and maybe one or two of those could be

1251
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,720
added at the same time.

1252
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,200
And something else just to add related

1253
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,000
to that is that we all know UB3 is the

1254
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,760
major gene that dramatically impacts

1255
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,359
phenotype. The other genes may

1256
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,440
contribute, but it also might be

1257
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,680
marginal. So I think with all the

1258
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,240
therapies being developed for deletion

1259
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,480
or any genotype UB3 replacement is the

1260
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:50,560
first step and then dealing with the

1261
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,599
other genes maybe a different modality

1262
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,240
an ASO a crisper editor a different

1263
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,240
technology that might be piled on top of

1264
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,160
something like this I don't think this

1265
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,440
technology will solve all of it

1266
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,440
certainly not for the next 10 years

1267
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,520
>> one question back there and then we're

1268
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,520
going to move

1269
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,680
Okay. I was just wondering um would this

1270
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,880
work for patients with UPD?

1271
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,280
>> Do you want me to answer that?

1272
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,240
>> Yeah.

1273
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,359
>> Okay. Um yes. So just like any gene

1274
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,839
replacement therapy, any genotype that

1275
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:37,119
is loss of function, meaning not

1276
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:39,040
producing, making or expressing UB3A,

1277
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,560
which would be deletion, loss of

1278
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:46,079
function, mutation, UPD or ICD or even

1279
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:49,280
mosaic would all benefit potentially

1280
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,359
from replacing UB3A. So this would

1281
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,319
likely be um genotype agnostic outside

1282
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,240
of mutations that could have any gain of

1283
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,079
function or dominant negative effect. So

1284
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,839
it would be any loss of function

1285
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,680
genotype.

1286
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,119
Similar to the AV gene therapy that

1287
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,000
we'll be talking about next.

1288
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,599
>> Okay. Thank you.

1289
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,440
>> We'll ask more questions on the panel

1290
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,920
and certainly reach out throughout the

1291
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,760
breaks. Feel free to walk up to Dr. Conn

1292
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,760
and tell him all about your child.
