**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents four new experimental tools and platforms designed to assess therapeutic activity and efficacy for Angelman syndrome, focusing on the gene UBE3A. The speaker describes a reporter cell line, a sensitive UBE3A bioactivity assay, a scalable electrophysiology platform for brain organoids, and single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of UBE3A loss in human cerebral organoids, all aimed at improving drug screening and disease monitoring.

## 1. UBE3A reporter cell line for therapeutic screening

- The group created a **human Angelman syndrome “class 2” reporter cell line** by integrating a **green fluorescent protein (GFP)** gene into the genome under control of paternal UBE3A. In Angelman syndrome, the paternal UBE3A allele is typically silenced in neurons; in this model, when paternal UBE3A is inactive, the cells appear “dark” (no green fluorescence). When a candidate drug successfully **reactivates or restores expression of paternal UBE3A**, the cells light up green, providing a direct visual readout of therapeutic activity. This fluorescence can be measured either by **microscopy** (looking at cells under a fluorescent microscope) or **flow cytometry** (quantifying fluorescence cell-by-cell), and importantly, **no antibody staining is needed**, which simplifies and speeds up screening. Actionably, this reporter line can be used in **high-throughput drug screening** to quickly identify compounds that restore UBE3A expression in a cell-based model of Angelman syndrome.

## 2. Rapid, sensitive UBE3A bioactivity assay

- The group developed a **rapid and highly sensitive assay** to detect **functional UBE3A enzymatic activity**, which is important for both **potency testing** of therapies and **biomarker assays** in disease monitoring. The assay has **10-fold or more improved sensitivity** (described as “one or more sensitivity”) compared to prior methods and can **distinguish wild-type UBE3A from mutant UBE3A**, meaning it detects not just presence but functional quality of the protein. It has been successfully applied to multiple biological sample types, including **human stem cell lysates**, **cell culture supernatants**, and **recombinant cell-penetrating peptide UBE3A** (a therapeutic format where UBE3A is delivered as a protein that can enter cells). This flexibility means the assay can be used both in **preclinical research** (e.g., testing gene therapies or protein replacement therapies) and potentially in **clinical biomarker development** (e.g., measuring UBE3A activity in patient-derived cells). Practically, this tool enables more precise **dose–response studies**, comparison of different therapeutic candidates, and monitoring of whether a therapy is restoring **functional** UBE3A, not just expression levels.

## 3. Scalable electrophysiology platform using macro-electrode arrays for organoids

- The team developed a **scalable electrophysiology platform** based on **macro-electrode arrays (MEAs)** designed for **brain organoids** (3D mini-brain models grown from stem cells). Each **basket-shaped MEA** can hold a single organoid and contains **12 independent macro-electrodes** that conformally interface with the organoid surface, allowing stable recording of its electrical activity. This setup supports **high-throughput recording of brain activity** and **drug screening**, enabling researchers to test how candidate therapies affect network-level neuronal function in many organoids in parallel. They report voltage recordings from **74 human organoids simultaneously**, which they note is the **largest organoid electrophysiology dataset** reported to date. Actionably, this platform can be used to assess whether therapies for Angelman syndrome not only restore molecular markers like UBE3A but also **normalize or improve brain network activity patterns** in a human-relevant model.

## 4. Single-cell RNA sequencing of UBE3A loss in human cerebral organoids

- The group analyzed the role of **UBE3A** in **human cerebral organoids** using **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)**, comparing **H9 wild-type** organoids to **H9 UBE3A double-knockout** organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing measures gene expression in individual cells, allowing detailed mapping of **cell types** and **developmental states** within the organoids. Their results show that absence of UBE3A affects **multiple cell types**, not only neurons, indicating that Angelman-related pathology may involve broader cellular populations in the brain. They observed changes in **cell type composition**, **cell proliferation**, **organoid size**, and **cortical development**, suggesting that UBE3A is important for normal brain growth and layering. These findings provide a **mechanistic framework** for interpreting how therapies that restore UBE3A might impact **brain development trajectories**, and they offer specific cellular and developmental readouts that can be used as **efficacy endpoints** in future studies.
