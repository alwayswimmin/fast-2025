**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk describes the development of a new caregiver-report tool, the Measure of Observable Outcomes of Distress in Angelman Syndrome (MOOD-AS). Because many individuals with Angelman syndrome cannot reliably report internal states like anxiety, the MOOD-AS focuses only on observable behaviors that may indicate distress. The project is in an early psychometric evaluation phase, with promising initial feedback from caregivers and early data on common and severe behaviors.

## 1. Rationale: Why a new measure of distress is needed in Angelman syndrome

- Many caregivers report that their loved one with Angelman syndrome experiences **anxiety** and shows behaviors such as aggression or clinginess, but anxiety itself is an **internal state** that cannot be directly observed.  
- Because many individuals with Angelman syndrome have limited or no spoken language, they cannot reliably describe their internal feelings, making standard anxiety measures inappropriate or incomplete.  
- The goal is therefore to create a tool that uses **only observable behaviors** (things others can see, like hand flapping, crying, or refusing to separate) to infer when a person might be distressed or anxious.  
- This approach respects the communication challenges in Angelman syndrome while still giving clinicians and researchers a structured way to track distress-related behaviors.  
- The resulting measure, MOOD-AS, is intended to be useful both in **clinical care** (to guide support and interventions) and in **research** (e.g., clinical trials, natural history studies).

## 2. Study design and four-phase development approach

- The team used a **four-phase approach** to build the MOOD-AS:  
  1) Concept elicitation interviews, 2) Mapping and item development, 3) Cognitive interviewing, and 4) Psychometric evaluation.  
- Concept elicitation means systematically asking caregivers what they see and how they describe distress-related behaviors, to ensure the measure reflects **real-world experiences**.  
- Mapping and item development involved turning caregiver language into specific, observable behavior items and aligning them with existing measures where possible.  
- Cognitive interviewing tested whether caregivers understood the questions as intended and whether the items accurately captured their loved one’s behaviors.  
- Psychometric evaluation (the current phase) will test how reliable and valid the measure is—whether it consistently measures what it is supposed to measure across people and settings.

## 3. Phase 1 – Concept elicitation interviews with caregivers

- The team conducted **23 interviews** with caregivers, with about half caring for individuals with a **deletion subtype** of Angelman syndrome and half with **non-deletion** subtypes.  
- Almost all caregivers reported behaviors they associated with anxiety, including **freezing**, **flinching more**, **crying**, **hand flapping**, and **aggression**.  
- A key finding was that common caregiver terms like **“clingy”** can mean very different things: increased whining when left alone, watching the caregiver’s every move, physically holding on, or even aggression toward others.  
- This showed that broad labels (e.g., “clingy”) are not specific enough for a measure; instead, the tool must ask about **concrete, observable actions** that can be clearly described and rated.  
- These interviews provided the raw material for the behavior list and helped define what each behavior actually looks like in daily life.

## 4. Phase 2 – Item generation and structure of the MOOD-AS

- Based on the interviews, the team created a **long list of behaviors** that caregivers had described and then narrowed it to behaviors that are **observable by others** (not internal feelings or assumptions).  
- The final preliminary list contains **69 behaviors**, each rated on two separate scales:  
  - **Frequency**: from “never” to “often”  
  - **Severity**: from “mild” to “severe”  
- This dual rating system allows the measure to capture both **how often** a behavior occurs and **how intense or disruptive** it is when it happens.  
- These 69 items together form the **Measure of Observable Outcomes of Distress in Angelman Syndrome (MOOD-AS)**.  
- The structure is designed so that it can be used in different settings (clinics, research studies, multi-country projects) while still giving standardized, comparable data.

## 5. Phase 3 – Cognitive interviewing and refinement of the measure

- Before wider use, the team conducted **cognitive testing** with **14 caregivers** to see how they understood the items and instructions.  
- Caregivers were asked whether the wording was clear, whether items matched their experience, and whether any questions were confusing or ambiguous.  
- Feedback was **very positive**, suggesting that the measure generally made sense and reflected real behaviors they see in their loved ones.  
- Only **minor revisions** were needed, such as small wording changes in instructions, severity items, and some impact-related items to improve clarity.  
- This step helps ensure that when different caregivers complete the MOOD-AS, they interpret the questions in a similar way, which is crucial for reliable data.

## 6. Phase 4 – Psychometric evaluation and early findings

- The project is now in the **psychometric evaluation** phase, collecting data through one-off surveys in **multiple countries and sites** and through the **Angelman natural history study**.  
- Data collection has just begun, but from the first **31 participants**, the most frequently endorsed behaviors include: **easily distracted**, **refusing to separate**, **pulling on others**, and **mouthing behaviors** (e.g., putting objects in the mouth).  
- The behaviors rated as most **severe** so far include: **reduced communication when upset**, **biting nails**, **checking the time**, **lying down**, and **mouthing behaviors**.  
- As more data are collected, the team will be able to test the measure’s reliability (consistency) and validity (whether it truly reflects distress/anxiety-related behaviors).  
- These early findings already highlight which behaviors are common and which may be particularly impactful or concerning for families.

## 7. Future directions, behavior clustering, and how to get involved

- With a larger dataset, the researchers aim to **categorize behaviors into clusters**, which may reveal patterns and underlying **functions** of behaviors (e.g., communication attempts vs. avoidance of situations).  
- For example, one cluster might reflect **communication-related distress** (behaviors that occur when the individual cannot express needs), while another might reflect **avoidance-related distress** (behaviors used to escape or avoid certain situations).  
- Understanding these clusters could help clinicians and families target **specific types of distress** with more tailored interventions and supports.  
- Caregivers who want to contribute by completing the MOOD-AS, and researchers or clinicians who wish to use the tool, are invited to **contact Dr. Wheeler** and her team to collaborate.  
- Dr. Wheeler notes that her colleague **Sarah Potter** is present at the conference and that she herself will be available on Saturday to answer questions and discuss the tool further.
