**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents early research on cerebral visual impairment (CVI) in people with Angelman syndrome, conducted at Boston Children’s Hospital. The speaker explains what CVI is, why it is often missed, how it can affect daily functioning and safety, and shares preliminary screening results from a small Angelman cohort using a standardized CVI screening tool. The ultimate aim is to understand how common CVI is in Angelman syndrome so that affected individuals can be identified and receive appropriate vision-related supports and therapies.

## 1. What is cerebral visual impairment (CVI)?

- **Definition:** CVI is a **neurological condition** where the brain’s visual processing pathways are affected, causing vision difficulties that **cannot be explained solely by eye problems** (ocular abnormalities). In other words, the eyes may be structurally normal or only mildly affected, but the brain has trouble processing what the eyes see. Individuals with CVI often struggle with **visual attention** (looking at and staying focused on things) and **visual recognition** (identifying objects, images, and people). CVI is considered a **leading cause of childhood blindness and low vision**, even though many children still have some usable vision. A key point is that CVI is about **how the brain uses visual information**, not just how clearly the eyes see.

**Actionable takeaway:** If a child seems to “see” inconsistently or has trouble using vision in real-world situations despite normal or near-normal eye exams, CVI should be considered and discussed with a vision specialist familiar with CVI.

## 2. Why CVI is relevant to Angelman syndrome

- Perkins School for the Blind estimates that **1 in 30 school-age children** have CVI-related vision difficulties, showing that this is not rare. Among children with CVI, **72% have developmental delays**, **64% have epilepsy**, and **20% have genetic anomalies**—all features that are **common in Angelman syndrome**, suggesting a strong overlap. CVI often co-occurs with other eye conditions like **strabismus** (eye misalignment) and **refractive errors** (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism), which can complicate recognition of CVI. Fewer than **20% of individuals with CVI receive a formal diagnosis**, making it a **highly underdiagnosed** condition. A CVI diagnosis is typically made by an **ophthalmologist or optometrist with specific CVI knowledge**, using a combination of visual evaluation, direct observation, and caregiver input.

**Actionable takeaway:** Because the risk profile for CVI overlaps strongly with Angelman syndrome, families and clinicians should **actively ask about and screen for CVI**, rather than assuming all visual issues are explained by eye exams or motor challenges.

## 3. Common CVI-related behaviors and functional difficulties

- Many individuals with CVI have trouble with:  
  - Navigating **indoor and outdoor spaces**  
  - Recognizing **objects, images, and people**  
  - **Tracking** moving objects or people  
  - Finding things in **visual clutter**  
  - Using vision together with other senses (e.g., looking and reaching)  
  - Managing **light sensitivity** or needing extra light  
- Caregivers in this study reported specific examples in Angelman syndrome that are consistent with CVI, such as:  
  - Difficulty distinguishing **familiar from unfamiliar faces**, needing voice or clothing cues to recognize people.  
  - Hesitation when **transitioning between surfaces** (e.g., wood floor to carpet), suggesting difficulty interpreting visual changes in the environment.  
  - **Tripping or falling over clearly visible objects** not due to motor weakness, but likely because the objects are not effectively “seen” or processed.  
  - Struggling with **steps or uneven surfaces**, preferring to **touch objects rather than look at them**, or reaching for an object while looking away.  
  - **Delayed response to movement** (not noticing people, cars, or balls passing by), distress in new environments, and attending only to objects directly in front of them, with poor awareness of peripheral or lower visual fields.

**Actionable takeaway:** If a child with Angelman syndrome shows these patterns—especially inconsistent visual responses, reliance on touch or sound over vision, or anxiety in visually complex environments—families should consider a **CVI-focused evaluation** and share these specific behaviors with clinicians.

## 4. Study purpose and design

- **Hypothesis:** Individuals with Angelman syndrome have an **increased risk for CVI** compared to the general population. The **goal** is to determine what proportion of individuals with Angelman syndrome **screen positive for CVI** using a standardized questionnaire. The study uses a **one-time virtual visit** with a research coordinator, during which the primary caregiver completes:  
  - A **visual health questionnaire** (visual concerns, past evaluations, current therapies, prior CVI evaluation/diagnosis).  
  - The **TeachCVI screening tool**, which asks about visual attention, recognition, movement perception, and visual-motor coordination.  
- There are **two versions** of the TeachCVI tool: one for **ambulatory** individuals (35 questions) and one for **non-ambulatory** individuals (19 questions), so that mobility-related questions are only asked when relevant. Participants are classified as having a **positive or negative screen** based on a scoring algorithm; a **positive screen suggests possible CVI but does not confirm a diagnosis**.

**Actionable takeaway:** The TeachCVI tool can be used in clinical practice as a **structured history tool** to support CVI evaluation; families can ask their providers whether such structured screening might be appropriate for their child.

## 5. Participants and demographics

- At the time of this talk, **20 participants** with Angelman syndrome had completed the study. The group had a **roughly equal number of males and females**, with ages ranging from **2 to 48 years**, and **70% under age 18**. In terms of molecular subtype, **75% had a deletion** and **25% had a mutation**; no participants yet had UPD (uniparental disomy) or imprinting defect, but the team plans to enroll these subtypes as the study continues. Regarding mobility, **55% walked independently** and **5% walked with support** (classified as ambulatory), while **40% were non-ambulatory** (using stroller/wheelchair or crawling/scooting). This mix allows the researchers to apply both versions of the TeachCVI tool and examine whether mobility status relates to CVI screening outcomes.

**Actionable takeaway:** The study is still small and skewed toward deletion and mutation subtypes, so families from **all Angelman subtypes and mobility levels** are encouraged to participate to improve the representativeness of the findings.

## 6. Preliminary screening results

- Among the 20 participants, **8 screened positive** for CVI and **12 screened negative** using the TeachCVI tool. Of the **8 positive screens**, **3 already had a formal CVI diagnosis**, while **5 had never been evaluated for CVI** by a vision specialist, suggesting potential under-recognition. Among the **12 negative screens**, **2 already had a formal CVI diagnosis**, and **10 had not been evaluated** for CVI. At this early stage, the team did **not observe significant differences** in screening outcomes across demographic groups (age, sex, subtype, ambulatory status), but they plan to monitor trends as the sample grows. These mixed results (some diagnosed individuals screening negative and some undiagnosed individuals screening positive) highlight both the **complexity of CVI assessment** and the **value of multiple sources of information** (clinical exam, history, and standardized tools).

**Actionable takeaway:** A **screening tool is not a diagnosis**; families should treat a positive screen as a prompt to seek a **comprehensive CVI evaluation**, and a negative screen does not completely rule out CVI, especially if functional concerns persist.

## 7. Recruitment, next steps, and acknowledgments

- The research team is **actively recruiting more participants** with Angelman syndrome of **all ages and molecular subtypes**. Interested caregivers can complete an **online interest form** (via QR code or a REDCap link mentioned in the talk) and may contact Emma directly by email with questions. The team is **especially interested in participants who have already had a formal CVI evaluation**, to better compare screening results with clinical diagnoses. Emma acknowledges collaborators at the **New England College of Optometry**, **Perkins School for the Blind**, and the broader **Angelman Syndrome Research Group at Boston Children’s Hospital**, as well as the families who have participated. As the study grows, they aim to better define **how common CVI is in Angelman syndrome** and how it presents across different subgroups.

**Actionable takeaway:** Families can contribute to improving understanding and care by **participating in research** and sharing their child’s visual history, especially if a CVI diagnosis or evaluation has already occurred.

## 8. Implications for families and educational planning

- In the closing remarks, the moderator emphasizes that recognizing CVI in Angelman syndrome can be **life-changing**, particularly when it leads to **vision therapy** and appropriate supports. There is hope that, once CVI is clearly shown to be a **significant problem in the Angelman community**, it will be easier to **secure vision-related services and accommodations on IEPs** (Individualized Education Programs). For example, one child’s **AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) device** setup changed substantially after a CVI diagnosis, with increased attention to **contrast and visual design** to make symbols more accessible. This illustrates how understanding CVI can reshape communication strategies, learning materials, and environmental adaptations. Overall, the message is that **proper identification and support for CVI can “change everything”** for many individuals with Angelman syndrome.

**Actionable takeaway:** Families should consider advocating for **CVI-informed accommodations** (e.g., high contrast materials, simplified visual fields, tailored AAC layouts, environmental modifications) in school and therapy plans, and explicitly request that **CVI and vision therapy** be discussed in IEP meetings when relevant.
