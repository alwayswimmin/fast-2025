**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk explains the ORCA (Observer-Reported Communication Ability) measure, a caregiver-completed tool specifically designed to capture communication abilities in people with Angelman syndrome. Dr. Abby Ruder describes how ORCA was built with caregiver input, how its scores are translated into real-life “vignettes,” and what counts as a *minimal meaningful change* in score from a parent’s perspective. The goal is to make ORCA scores understandable and usable in clinical trials, regulatory discussions, and everyday family decision-making.

### 1. Why a new communication measure was needed for Angelman syndrome

- To evaluate any new treatment, outcome measures must be **“fit for purpose”**—they must measure what they are supposed to measure, and work well in the specific population being studied. Many existing communication measures (like the Bayley and Vineland) were designed for **verbal, typically developing** children and focus heavily on spoken words and word approximations. For Angelman syndrome, this misses crucial communication forms such as eye gaze, gestures, AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) devices, signs, and symbols. As a result, traditional tools often under-represent real gains that families see in their children’s communication. The community, FAST, and researchers therefore set out to build a measure from scratch that truly reflects how people with Angelman communicate and how they change over time.

### 2. What ORCA is and what it measures

- **ORCA** stands for **Observer-Reported Communication Ability** and is a caregiver-report measure built specifically for Angelman syndrome, with heavy input from caregivers and FAST leadership. It focuses on three domains of communication:
  - **Expressive:** how the child conveys needs, thoughts, and emotions (e.g., eye gaze, pointing, sounds, AAC use).
  - **Receptive:** how the child shows understanding of what is said (e.g., following directions, responding to “no/stop,” answering questions).
  - **Pragmatic/social:** how the child uses communication in social contexts (e.g., getting attention, back-and-forth interaction).
- ORCA was developed using rigorous, accepted psychometric methods and a complex scoring algorithm, but raw scores (e.g., 35, 50, 65) by themselves are not intuitively meaningful to families. The project’s next step was to translate these scores into concrete descriptions of what a child at each score is likely to be able to do.

### 3. How ORCA scores are turned into understandable “vignettes”

- Using ORCA’s statistical model, the team can estimate the **most likely communication behaviors** at each possible score on the scale (roughly 20–80). From these probabilities, they build **vignettes**—short, plain-language profiles of a hypothetical child at a given score, describing what that child “almost always,” “sometimes,” or “never” does in each communication domain. These vignettes are not real children but **representative examples** that make the numbers concrete and relatable. The method can generate a vignette for **any** ORCA score or score change, not just a few points. This same approach can also be applied to other measures and other neurodevelopmental conditions.

### 4. Example vignettes at different ORCA scores (35, 50, 65)

- **Score 35 (Alex – higher end of the low range):**  
  - Alex sometimes communicates wants by reaching or pointing, making a sound, looking at the object, or bringing the object to a parent.  
  - To get attention, Alex almost always grabs, taps, pulls on someone, or makes a sound.  
  - Some higher-level skills on the ORCA (e.g., consistent AAC use, multi-word approximations) are not yet present at this level.  
  - The vignette emphasizes what Alex *can* do, while acknowledging that some skills appear only at higher scores.

- **Score 50 (Jamie – mid-range):**  
  - Jamie is typically able to use an **AAC device**; this is a key feature of the mid-range score.  
  - In the “get attention” domain, Jamie sometimes uses a symbol on the device (or a word approximation) to get a parent’s attention.  
  - While the ORCA wording includes “word approximations,” in real life, at a score of 50, consistent spoken approximations may still be rare.  
  - Overall, this level reflects more intentional, symbol-based communication than at 35, especially via AAC.

- **Score 65 (Riley – higher range):**  
  - Riley can use **one- to three-word phrases or word approximations**, marking a major step in expressive communication.  
  - For getting attention, Riley almost always uses a symbol on a device or a word approximation, rather than just grabbing or making undifferentiated sounds.  
  - This level reflects more consistent, flexible, and complex communication across situations.  
  - The progression from Alex (35) to Jamie (50) to Riley (65) illustrates how ORCA scores map onto increasingly advanced real-world skills.

### 5. Determining what counts as a “meaningful change” in ORCA scores

- Having vignettes is useful, but for clinical trials and families, the key question is: **“How many points of change actually matter in real life?”** To answer this, the team showed caregivers **pairs of vignettes** representing different score changes (2, 4, 6, 8 points) and asked whether the change described would be meaningful for a hypothetical child with Angelman. Caregivers were not told the numeric size of the change; they judged only by the described behaviors. At a **2-point change**, more than **half of caregivers** said the improvement would be meaningful to them. This indicates that even relatively small numerical changes on ORCA can correspond to changes that families value and notice in daily life.

### 6. What specific changes a 2–4 point ORCA increase can represent

- A **2-point increase** on ORCA, though small relative to the full 20–80 range, can correspond to **substantial functional gains**, such as:
  - Going from only responding to “no/stop” to **sometimes following one-step directions** (e.g., “give me the ball”).  
  - Going from **never** answering yes/no questions to **sometimes** answering them.  
  - For children already sometimes answering yes/no, beginning to **sometimes answer open-ended questions** (e.g., “What do you want?”), which is a major leap in communication complexity.
- A **3-point change** includes all of the above and, for some higher-functioning children, may be where **symbol use** (e.g., on AAC) begins to appear.  
- A **4-point change** can include the emergence of **one- to three-word phrases or word approximations** in some relatively high-functioning children, though this is still uncommon at that level.  
- More consistent use of multi-word approximations tends to appear around an **8-point change**, where the probability of these skills “levels out” in the data.  
- Overall, the study confirms that **small numeric changes (2–3 points)** can reflect changes that are deeply meaningful to families, aligning with what caregivers already intuitively know.

### 7. Future directions for ORCA and broader impact on trials and families

- The current findings on meaningful change are **preliminary**, and the team plans to continue collecting data to refine estimates of what score differences matter most. They are also working on defining **ability regions** (e.g., low, intermediate, high communication ability) to help clinicians and families interpret where a child falls on the ORCA scale. ORCA is being **translated and adapted** for use in other neurodevelopmental conditions, with the same vignette-based approach to interpretation. For Angelman syndrome, ORCA is already being used in clinical trials and is one of the first outcome measures built entirely from scratch with direct caregiver collaboration. This work supports discussions with regulators (like the FDA) by providing evidence that small ORCA score changes represent real, valued improvements in communication, and it gives families a more precise, granular way to see and track the communication gains they care about most.
