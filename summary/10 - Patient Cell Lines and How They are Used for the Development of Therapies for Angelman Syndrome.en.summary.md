**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk explains how patient blood samples from individuals with Angelman syndrome are turned into stem-cell–derived human neurons and “mini-brains” (organoids) that can be used to develop and test new therapies. The speaker describes the creation of a large, freely available biorepository of Angelman syndrome induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines covering all major genotypes, and shows how these cells are already being used to test gene-editing approaches and other treatments in a human-relevant system.

### 1. Limitations of mouse models and the need for human neurons

- Mouse models of Angelman syndrome have been extremely valuable, and Dr. Jiang himself created the first such model, plus newer models with larger deletions that may better mimic human disease.  
- However, mice are not humans: while many **mechanisms and concepts are conserved**, the **DNA sequence** and fine details of brain structure differ significantly.  
- For therapies like **antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)**, which depend on exact DNA/RNA sequences, results in mice do **not** directly translate to humans; sequences must be redesigned and retested.  
- This creates a gap: animal models can show whether a concept works, but **human-specific testing** is needed before moving to clinical trials.  
- Therefore, researchers need **human neurons**—cells that carry human DNA and human-specific regulatory sequences—to bridge the gap between animal studies and human therapies.

### 2. What iPSCs are and why they matter for Angelman syndrome

- **iPSC** stands for **induced pluripotent stem cell**: an adult cell (like a blood cell) that has been “reprogrammed” back into a stem cell state, capable of becoming many cell types.  
- This reprogramming technology, developed by Shinya Yamanaka (Nobel Prize ~15 years ago), allows scientists to take a patient’s blood and convert those cells into **“baby” stem cells** in a dish.  
- From these iPSCs, researchers can generate **human neurons** that carry the exact **Angelman genotype** (deletion, UBE3A mutation, imprinting defect, UPD, etc.) of that specific child.  
- This is crucial because it lets scientists study **Angelman syndrome in human cells**, not just in mice, and test whether candidate therapies can restore UBE3A expression or correct cellular defects.  
- iPSCs thus serve as a **personalized, renewable source** of disease-relevant human cells for research and drug development.

### 3. Building the Angelman iPSC biorepository during COVID

- Around 2020–2021, in the middle of COVID, Dr. Jiang and Allison (FAST) decided to build a **comprehensive biorepository** of Angelman patient iPSC lines across all major genotypes.  
- Families were contacted, the **IRB (ethics board) process** was explained, and parents signed consent forms after understanding what would be done with their child’s samples.  
- Blood was collected locally (often with help from pediatricians) and shipped to Yale, despite COVID-related challenges.  
- The lab then processed the blood (spinning down, isolating cells) and performed safety testing (e.g., **mycoplasma**, **hepatitis B/C**, and **COVID**).  
- Using reprogramming methods, they converted these adult blood cells into iPSCs, ultimately generating **15 iPSC lines** representing all key Angelman genotypes, plus control lines.

### 4. Quality control and validation of the iPSC lines

- After reprogramming, the team had to ensure that each iPSC line still **carried the correct Angelman genotype** and had not acquired unwanted genetic changes.  
- They confirmed that the **Angelman-related mutation or deletion** was preserved and that no additional harmful genetic alterations were introduced during reprogramming.  
- They checked that the cells were truly **pluripotent** (i.e., genuine stem cells) using standard **pluripotency markers**—specific proteins or genes that stem cells express.  
- They also performed a **teratoma assay**: injecting the iPSCs into immune-deficient mice to see if they can form benign tumors containing multiple tissue types (e.g., neuron-like cells, muscle), which is a classic test of pluripotency.  
- Once validated, the lines were expanded, frozen into many vials, and stored so they could be **rapidly shipped** to investigators and companies worldwide.

### 5. Making human neurons: 2D cultures and 3D organoids (“mini-brains”)

- From the iPSCs, the lab generates two main types of human neuronal models: **2D neurons** and **3D organoids**.  
- **2D neurons** are neurons grown in a flat layer on a dish, where individual cells and their processes can be easily seen and measured; these are useful for high-throughput testing and imaging.  
- **3D organoids** (also called **brain organoids** or **3D neurons**) are small, three-dimensional structures that mimic aspects of the human brain’s organization, containing multiple cell types and more complex architecture.  
- Although organoids are “mini-brains” and not perfect replicas, they are currently the **best available in vitro model** for capturing some of the complexity of human brain development and circuitry.  
- Both 2D and 3D systems are used to test candidate therapies, measure UBE3A reactivation, and study disease mechanisms in a human context.

### 6. Using patient-derived neurons to test gene-editing therapies

- Dr. Jiang’s group is using these human neurons to test **gene-editing approaches** (e.g., CRISPR-based) delivered by **non-viral, nanoparticle** methods.  
- They design and screen many different **guide RNAs (gRNAs)**—the CRISPR components that direct editing to specific DNA sequences—to find which ones most effectively reactivate the paternal UBE3A allele.  
- In 2D neurons, they can quickly test ~20 different guides and quantify which ones give the strongest **reactivation signal**, often visualized as a **green fluorescent protein (EGFP)** attached to UBE3A.  
- In 3D organoids, they see similar results: after treatment, the organoids show strong green fluorescence, indicating successful editing and **reactivation of UBE3A** in a more complex, brain-like structure.  
- These experiments demonstrate that the iPSC-derived neurons are a **powerful screening platform** to optimize gene-editing tools before moving to animal models and, eventually, human trials.

### 7. Precision medicine potential and genotype-specific responses

- Angelman syndrome is **genetically heterogeneous**: some children have large deletions, others have UBE3A point mutations, imprinting defects, or uniparental disomy (UPD), and even “same” deletions can differ in size and content.  
- Parents often notice that “my child’s deletion is not the same as your child’s,” and this heterogeneity can influence how well a given therapy works.  
- In principle, **precision medicine** would mean: for each patient, generate iPSCs, make neurons, test the therapy in that patient’s cells, and see how well UBE3A is reactivated or function is restored before treating the person.  
- Dr. Jiang shows that in neurons from a patient with a **large deletion**, CRISPR-based editing can still produce **robust UBE3A reactivation**, even if not 100%, which may be clinically meaningful (e.g., 20–40% vs. 5–10% restoration).  
- While it is not currently feasible to create personalized cell lines for every individual, these models **prove the concept** and highlight how genotype-specific testing can guide future therapy development and stratification.

### 8. Access, impact, and future use of the Angelman iPSC resource

- The 15 Angelman iPSC lines (covering deletion, UPD, UBE3A mutation, imprinting defect, etc.) and controls have been deposited in a public repository (referred to as **EBiSC**), making them **freely accessible** worldwide.  
- FAST and Dr. Jiang insisted that these lines be **free to distribute**, including to pharmaceutical companies, so that no one has to “reinvent the wheel” or recollect samples.  
- The lines have already been distributed to **many principal investigators and several companies**, and at least **two research papers** using these lines are under review.  
- This resource not only accelerates **Angelman-specific therapy development** but can also help other disease communities, who may request Angelman lines as comparison or control models.  
- Dr. Jiang emphasizes that this entire effort was only possible because families donated blood and FAST provided support; those samples have literally become **human neurons in a dish** that are now driving drug development for the whole community.
