**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk describes a new strategy for delivering gene therapies to the brain by engineering AAV (adeno-associated virus) capsids that can cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) using the human transferrin receptor. Dr. Andrew Steinapper explains how his company, Apertura Gene Therapy, is building these “second-generation” delivery tools to enable safer, lower-dose, and more broadly accessible treatments for Angelman syndrome and many other rare neurological diseases. He emphasizes collaboration with patient advocacy groups and transparent sharing of data and roadmaps so that the entire rare disease community can benefit.

## 1. Why new versions of gene therapy delivery are needed

- Gene therapy for Angelman and other disorders cannot stop at “version 1”; there must be **version 2, version 3, and beyond** as science advances.  
- Existing AAV-based therapies have changed lives (e.g., Zolgensma for SMA1), but they were built using **naturally occurring AAV capsids** that were never “designed” for human gene therapy.  
- These first-generation tools often require **high doses**, can be hard to administer, and may not optimally reach the brain when given intravenously.  
- Andrew’s team set out to **design new capsids from the ground up**, using what has been learned from other drug modalities (like antibodies) to target specific receptors and tissues.  
- The goal is to create tools that make it easier, safer, and more scalable to treat many patients, not just a few in early trials.

## 2. What AAV gene therapy is and why natural AAV is limited

- **AAV (Adeno-Associated Virus)** is used as a **delivery vehicle**: its own viral genes are removed and replaced with therapeutic “software” (e.g., a working copy of UBE3A or gene-editing instructions).  
- Andrew likens AAV to a **software update**: it enters cells and drops off new genetic instructions that cells can read and use, often without needing repeated dosing.  
- Different natural AAV types (serotypes) have different “preferences” for tissues (brain, liver, eye, muscle), but they evolved for their own biology, not for human therapy.  
- As a result, we have mostly been using **research tools**—natural capsids that happen to work “well enough” in some tissues—rather than purpose-built delivery systems.  
- This creates limitations in efficiency, dose, and safety, especially when trying to reach the **central nervous system (CNS)** through the bloodstream.

## 3. A novel capsid that uses the human transferrin receptor to cross the BBB

- The **blood–brain barrier (BBB)** is a protective layer of cells that tightly controls what can enter the brain from the blood; most large molecules and viruses cannot cross it easily.  
- Andrew’s team engineered an AAV capsid that **binds to the human transferrin receptor (TfR)**, a natural receptor whose job is to ferry iron (bound to the protein transferrin) across the BBB.  
- **Transferrin receptor (TfR):**  
  - Binds transferrin, which carries iron safely in the blood (free iron is toxic).  
  - Acts like a **ferry** to move transferrin–iron complexes into the brain, where iron is needed for energy and brain function.  
- By designing the capsid to engage this receptor, they can “hitch a ride” across the BBB, using a **normal physiological pathway** rather than forcing entry.  
- This receptor has already been used in **hundreds of patients** (children and adults) to deliver biologic drugs (like enzymes) in other programs (e.g., Hunter syndrome), giving a strong safety precedent for targeting TfR—though never before with a virus.

## 4. Potential impact across Angelman and other rare neurological diseases

- The same BBB-crossing capsid can, in principle, be used as a **platform** for many diseases: you change the genetic “payload” inside, but keep the delivery vehicle.  
- Angelman syndrome is explicitly on their list, but Andrew stresses that this is also for **ultra-rare conditions**—the “five letters and two numbers” diseases with only a few researchers.  
- Using a common, well-characterized capsid could allow different groups to **reuse the same delivery tool**, making it easier to develop multiple therapies more consistently.  
- This approach supports both **neurological disorders** (where brain targeting is crucial) and **neurometabolic disorders** (where both brain and peripheral organs may need treatment).  
- The vision is that once the platform is validated, many diseases can “plug in” their specific gene or editing payload and move faster toward clinical trials.

## 5. Development timelines, safety work, and regulatory path

- Apertura is advancing multiple rare disease programs, with **one expected to enter human trials at the end of 2026** and **another at the beginning of 2027**.  
- Families often feel this is too slow, but Andrew emphasizes they are **not cutting corners**: they are running the right experiments in the right order to ensure safety and robustness.  
- Even though the transferrin receptor has extensive safety data with other drug types, **using it with a viral vector is new**, so they must generate specific safety data.  
- They have conducted critical studies in **mice and non-human primates** to understand how the capsid behaves, how it distributes, and what doses are appropriate.  
- This careful preclinical work is essential to gain regulatory confidence and to protect patients in first-in-human trials.

## 6. Partnerships with advocacy groups and commitment to access

- Apertura’s **first partnership** was not with a pharma company but with the **Rett Syndrome Research Trust**, a patient advocacy organization similar in spirit to FAST.  
- They are also working with multiple other rare disease groups, aiming to make the technology available to **academia, companies, and advocacy foundations** alike.  
- A core principle is that **money, time, and access should not be the main barriers** for rare disease communities to use this technology.  
- Andrew stresses that the **stakeholders**—patients, families, and advocacy groups—must be involved early, because they are the ones who will ultimately use and live with these therapies.  
- This model is meant to ensure that the platform is not locked away but can be broadly leveraged across many conditions.

## 7. Preclinical data: lower doses, better brain targeting, and liver/brain balance

- In mouse studies, their first-generation transferrin-receptor–targeted capsid achieved **very high levels of brain transduction** at **doses ~50-fold lower** than those used in currently approved IV AAV therapies.  
- Visual data showed a mouse brain with widespread green signal (cells that received the “software update”), indicating that **almost all brain cells** were transduced at these low doses.  
- Compared to AAV9 (which is inefficient for IV brain delivery in adult mice) and a mouse-only capsid, their **TFR1 capsid** (human TfR-targeted) showed superior brain uptake.  
- Importantly, at these doses, the **amount of virus in the brain (CNS) was roughly similar to that in the liver**, whereas standard capsids often show liver:brain ratios of 100:1 or 1000:1.  
- This means they can potentially **lower total dose**, reduce off-target exposure (especially to liver), and better match where the virus goes to where it is needed for neurological and neurometabolic diseases.

## 8. Using humanized mouse models and existing data to speed second-generation therapies

- For regulatory planning, they use **mice engineered to express the human transferrin receptor** (“knock-in” mice), so the capsid interacts with the exact same receptor as in humans.  
- This allows these mice to serve as a **direct model for human dosing**, because the receptor–capsid interaction and dose–response are more predictable and translatable.  
- They have already aligned with the **FDA** on the development path for programs in **TSC (tuberous sclerosis complex)** and **prion disease** (with Sonia Vallabh), using this approach.  
- A key goal is to ensure that **existing preclinical data** from earlier capsids and programs can be **leveraged rather than discarded** when transitioning to this new capsid.  
- This reduces duplication of effort and lets researchers and foundations build **second-generation products** more efficiently, standing on prior work instead of starting over.

## 9. Transparency, shared roadmaps, and a collaborative vision for rare disease

- Apertura has made its **blueprints and roadmaps publicly available**, without confidentiality agreements, so that advocacy groups, parents, and academics can access them.  
- This includes “explainer guides” for people who want to help move programs forward but do not have decades of drug development experience.  
- Andrew emphasizes **continuous transparency**, including sharing challenges and setbacks, so that the entire community can learn and improve together.  
- He closes with a philosophy from a mentor: it’s not “which disease do I want to work on?” but “**why not that one too?**” – reflecting a commitment to many rare conditions, not just a few.  
- Their overarching aim is not only to create a **next generation of gene therapy tools**, but also to foster a **next generation of collaboration** across the rare disease ecosystem, ensuring technologies like this are available to groups like FAST and beyond.
