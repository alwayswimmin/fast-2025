**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents early but promising results from a stem cell gene therapy approach for Angelman syndrome that uses blood stem cells to deliver the missing UBE3A protein to the brain. In a mouse model of Angelman syndrome, this strategy improved motor skills, cognition, and EEG (delta power) abnormalities to near-normal levels. The work is preclinical but is being advanced toward human trials through a collaboration between UCLA and FAST/Transformatics.

### 1. Meeting format and expectations for the lightning presentations

- The session is structured as rapid “lightning” talks: 5 minutes, 5 slides, no questions or extended explanations.  
- Presenters are told not to re-explain what Angelman syndrome is or list symptoms; parents already know this.  
- The focus must be on: what was done, what the results are, and how this could help children with Angelman syndrome.  
- Attendees will vote (via a QR code/app) for the best abstract, with the winner announced the next morning.  
- The goal is to show parents concrete outcomes from the time, money, and emotional investment they’ve put into research.

### 2. Concept: Using blood stem cell gene therapy to treat the brain

- The central idea is to “use the blood to treat the brain” by modifying blood-forming stem cells so they can help correct the brain’s UBE3A deficiency.  
- **Blood stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells, HSCs)** live in the bone marrow and give rise to all blood and immune cells.  
- In gene therapy, these HSCs are taken from the patient, genetically modified in the lab, and then returned to the same patient (an “autologous” transplant).  
- This approach is already used in other diseases (e.g., some immune deficiencies, metabolic disorders), providing a conceptual and safety foundation.  
- For Angelman syndrome, the therapeutic goal is to restore or supply UBE3A, the protein that is deficient in neurons.

### 3. Mechanism: How modified blood stem cells deliver UBE3A to the brain

- First, HSCs are **mobilized** from the bone marrow into the blood and collected from the patient.  
- In the lab, these cells are exposed to a **viral vector** (a modified virus used as a delivery tool) that inserts a working UBE3A gene into the stem cells.  
- After modification, the HSCs are infused back into the patient as a bone marrow transplant; the patient effectively becomes their own donor, reducing rejection risk.  
- As these modified stem cells repopulate the blood, they generate immune cells called **monocytes**, which can cross the **blood–brain barrier** and become resident brain immune cells (microglia-like cells).  
- These brain-engrafted immune cells are engineered to **secrete UBE3A**, acting as “little cell factories” that release UBE3A to nearby neurons that lack it.

### 4. Mouse study design and treatment groups

- The team tested this strategy in **Angelman syndrome mouse models**, which mimic key aspects of the human condition.  
- Two different viral vectors (Vector 1 and Vector 2) were used to deliver UBE3A, allowing comparison of performance and safety.  
- Four main groups were compared:  
  - Wild-type (neurotypical) mice  
  - Untreated Angelman syndrome mice  
  - Angelman mice treated with Vector 1  
  - Angelman mice treated with Vector 2  
- Outcomes were measured in multiple domains: motor function, cognition/behavior, and EEG brain activity.  
- This multi-assay approach helps show whether the therapy improves not just one symptom but the broader Angelman-like phenotype.

### 5. Motor function results (rotarod assay)

- **Rotarod assay:** Mice are placed on a rotating rod; the time they can stay on before falling is a standard measure of motor coordination and balance.  
- In the data shown, treated Angelman mice (red and blue lines for the two vectors) performed similarly to wild-type mice (purple), indicating near-normal motor function.  
- Untreated Angelman mice (brown) performed significantly worse, falling off sooner, consistent with known motor deficits in Angelman models.  
- The improvement in treated mice suggests that supplying UBE3A via stem cell gene therapy can correct motor abnormalities.  
- This provides functional evidence that the therapy is not just changing a biomarker but actually improving a meaningful behavior.

### 6. Cognitive results (novel object recognition assay)

- **Novel object recognition test:** Mice are exposed to one familiar object and one new (“novel”) object; neurotypical mice naturally spend more time exploring the novel object.  
- Angelman syndrome mice typically show reduced preference for the novel object, reflecting cognitive and memory impairments.  
- The team used a **discrimination index**: a positive score means the mouse prefers the novel object (more neurotypical behavior).  
- Wild-type mice had positive discrimination scores, as expected, and importantly, **all treated Angelman mice also had positive scores**, indicating improved cognitive function.  
- Untreated Angelman mice did not show this positive preference, underscoring that the gene therapy produced a meaningful cognitive/behavioral benefit.

### 7. EEG results (delta power normalization)

- **Delta power** refers to the strength of slow brain waves (delta frequency) on EEG; Angelman syndrome is characterized by abnormally high delta power.  
- Over a 24-hour EEG recording, untreated Angelman mice (brown) showed the expected **elevated delta power** throughout the day.  
- Treated mice (red and blue) closely followed the wild-type mice (purple) in their delta power trajectory, indicating normalization of this brain activity marker.  
- When averaged over 24 hours, delta power in treated mice was significantly lower than in untreated Angelman mice and essentially matched wild-type levels.  
- This suggests that the therapy not only changes behavior but also corrects a core, measurable brain abnormality associated with Angelman syndrome.

### 8. Safety considerations and clinical relevance of the vectors

- Both viral vectors used in the study employ **promoters** (DNA switches that turn the gene on) with a strong, established **clinical safety track record** in other gene therapy applications.  
- Using clinically validated promoters is important because it reduces the risk of unexpected overexpression or misexpression of UBE3A.  
- The fact that two different vectors both produced beneficial effects increases confidence that the result is robust and not dependent on a single construct.  
- While safety in mice does not guarantee safety in humans, these design choices are aligned with current best practices in clinical gene therapy.  
- Dr. Don Kohn’s upcoming talk is expected to go deeper into the safety, vector design, and clinical translation aspects.

### 9. Next steps: Translational work toward human clinical trials

- The current results are **preclinical** and limited to mouse models, but they are described as “very encouraging.”  
- Based on these findings, **FAST, Transformatics, and UCLA** have partnered to perform the necessary **translational studies** (e.g., dosing, toxicology, manufacturing) required by regulators.  
- The goal of these studies is to generate the data package needed to support a **human clinical trial** of HSC gene therapy for Angelman syndrome.  
- This includes scaling up vector production, refining protocols, and ensuring safety and consistency.  
- The work is positioned as a concrete path from basic research to a first-in-human trial, contingent on successful completion of these steps and regulatory approval.

### 10. Acknowledgments and closing

- Colin thanks the broader team, highlighting **Chris Luthers** (spelled “Luther’s” in transcript) as a key leader of the studies at UCLA.  
- He acknowledges **FAST** not only for funding but for comprehensive support at every stage of the project.  
- He also thanks the audience—primarily families and advocates—for their attention and ongoing support.  
- The talk is framed as a “teaser,” with more detailed data and discussion to come in Dr. Kohn’s keynote at 8:30 the next day.  
- The session moderator responds positively, reinforcing that this is exactly the kind of results-focused presentation families want to hear.
