**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
The talk describes how CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can be used to increase the activity of specific genes as a therapeutic strategy, especially when one working copy of a gene is not enough (haploinsufficiency). The speaker explains how his lab is now applying this approach to Angelman syndrome patients who have larger chromosomal deletions that remove multiple genes beyond UBE3A, with the goal of upregulating several missing genes at once.

### 1. Gene regulatory elements: promoters and enhancers

- Genes are controlled by **regulatory elements**, which determine when, where, and how strongly a gene is expressed. A **promoter** is a DNA region right next to a gene that acts like an on/off switch, initiating transcription (making RNA from DNA). **Enhancers** are more distant “dimmer switches” that can be far away in the genome but still control the promoter, fine-tuning how much of the gene is expressed in specific tissues or time points. These elements can increase or decrease gene expression levels, which is crucial when trying to correct diseases caused by too little gene product. Dr. Nadav’s lab focuses on understanding and manipulating these regulatory elements as therapeutic levers.

### 2. Concept of haploinsufficiency and low gene dosage diseases

- **Haploinsufficiency** means that having only one functional copy of a gene (instead of two) is not enough for normal function and leads to disease. Normally, we inherit one copy of each gene from each parent, and together they produce a full, healthy level of gene product. If one copy is lost or non-functional, the remaining copy may only produce about 50% of the normal amount, which in some genes is insufficient and causes disease. There are at least **660 known human genes** where haploinsufficiency leads to disease, including many severe epilepsies and cancers, and genomic data suggest there may be thousands more where losing one copy is never seen in healthy people. The central therapeutic idea is: if one copy still works but is under-expressed, can we safely **turn it up** to compensate?

### 3. CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) as a tool to boost gene expression

- Standard **CRISPR-Cas9** is known as a “molecular scissors” that cuts DNA to edit it; Dr. Nadav’s lab uses a modified version that **cannot cut DNA**. This “dead” Cas9 (dCas9) still finds specific DNA sequences (like a zip code) but instead of cutting, it acts as a **delivery truck** to bring other proteins to that spot. By attaching an **activator** domain to dCas9 and guiding it to a gene’s promoter or enhancer, they can **force that gene’s switch to turn up**, making more RNA and protein—this is called **CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)**. In haploinsufficient diseases, CRISPRa is used to target the remaining healthy copy of the gene and increase its output to near-normal levels. This approach changes **gene expression** without permanently altering the DNA sequence, which may have safety and flexibility advantages.

### 4. Proof-of-concept successes: obesity (SIM1) and SCN2A neurodevelopmental disorder

- The lab first tested CRISPRa in a mouse model of **obesity** caused by haploinsufficiency of the **SIM1** gene: mice with one defective SIM1 copy become extremely obese. By using CRISPRa to boost expression from the remaining SIM1 copy, they produced mice with the same genotype that looked and behaved like normal (wild-type) mice, showing that upregulation can correct the phenotype. More recently, they applied the same strategy to **SCN2A**, one of the top neurodevelopmental disorder genes associated with epilepsy and developmental delay, and published this work in *Nature*. In SCN2A mice, CRISPRa restored **action potentials** (the electrical signals neurons use to communicate), improved neuronal maturation even in more adult mice, and **rescued seizures**. They also showed rescue of neuronal function in **human neurons in a dish**, derived from human cells and differentiated into neurons over two months, indicating the approach can work in human cells as well as in mice.

### 5. Application to Angelman syndrome patients with microdeletions beyond UBE3A

- In Angelman syndrome, much current therapeutic focus is on restoring **UBE3A**, but some patients have **larger microdeletions** on chromosome 15 that remove **multiple genes** (about 16 genes), not just UBE3A. Even if UBE3A is successfully fixed in these patients, they may still have problems because they are missing one copy of several other important genes. Dr. Nadav’s group has identified **five candidate genes** within this deleted region (highlighted in red in his slide) that are likely **haploinsufficient**—meaning one copy is not enough, similar to SIM1 or SCN2A. The idea is to use CRISPRa to **upregulate these five genes simultaneously** from the remaining copy, compensating for the deletion. If successful, this could address a major unmet need in Angelman patients with microdeletions who may not fully benefit from UBE3A-only therapies.

### 6. Current experimental progress and next steps in cells and mouse models

- The team designed CRISPRa **guide RNAs** for each of the five target genes and optimized conditions in cells to find guides that effectively increase expression. They then packaged the CRISPRa system into an **adeno-associated virus (AAV)**, a commonly used gene therapy delivery vector, creating a single vector that can target and upregulate all five genes at once. In cell experiments, this AAV construct successfully **upregulated all five genes** to a significant degree, demonstrating technical feasibility. They are now collaborating with Dr. Yong-Hui’s lab to test these AAVs in **Angelman-relevant human cell lines** (the same types of neuronal models shown earlier) to see whether boosting all five genes leads to measurable therapeutic benefits. In parallel, they are working in **mouse models**, troubleshooting one particularly difficult gene (**GABRG3**), which is expressed at very low levels, and plan to move into a mouse model where the deletion is present but UBE3A is already rescued, to test whether upregulating the other genes improves phenotypes.

### 7. Broader implications for other microdeletion syndromes

- If this multi-gene CRISPRa strategy works for Angelman patients with microdeletions, it could be a **template for many other disorders**. There are roughly **200 known human syndromes** caused by microdeletions—regions where multiple neighboring genes are missing or reduced to one copy. Many of these likely involve haploinsufficiency of several genes at once, making single-gene therapies insufficient. A platform that can **simultaneously upregulate multiple genes** within a deleted region could be transformative across this entire class of disorders. The speaker emphasizes that success here would not only be a major advance for Angelman syndrome but could open therapeutic avenues for hundreds of other microdeletion conditions.
