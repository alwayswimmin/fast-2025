## 1. What biomarkers are and how they differ from clinical outcomes/endpoints

- **Biomarkers** are **objective, measurable characteristics in the body** (e.g., EEG signals, blood proteins, MRI findings), not how a person feels or functions directly.  
- In contrast, **clinical outcomes** are things like communication ability, mobility, sleep quality, or daily living skills—how the person actually functions in daily life.  
- For Angelman syndrome, the ABOM group is especially interested in **EEG**, **MRI**, and **CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)** as biomarker sources because they reflect brain function and biology relevant to the condition.  
- Biomarkers can be measured repeatedly and quantitatively, which makes them powerful tools to track biological changes over time.  
- They do not replace clinical outcomes but can **support, predict, or explain** changes in those outcomes.

## 2. Types and roles of biomarkers in drug development (including surrogate endpoints)

- The FDA describes several biomarker roles: **diagnostic** (e.g., gene test confirming Angelman), **safety** (e.g., baseline antibodies that might make a treatment unsafe), and **efficacy** biomarkers that predict or indicate treatment response.  
- ABOM is especially focused on **efficacy biomarkers**, sometimes called **surrogate endpoints**, which are biomarkers used in place of a direct clinical outcome to judge whether a drug works.  
- A **surrogate endpoint** is a biomarker (like blood pressure) that is strongly linked to a meaningful clinical outcome (like stroke risk), so regulators may accept it instead of waiting for the clinical event.  
- To use a biomarker as a surrogate endpoint, you need **extensive evidence** showing a reliable relationship between changes in the biomarker and changes in how patients feel or function.  
- This evidence usually comes from multiple clinical trials and long-term data, which is what is still being built for Angelman biomarkers.

## 3. Patient-relevant outcomes and the concept of endpoints in Angelman syndrome

- An **endpoint** is the specific thing measured in a clinical trial to decide if a drug is **safe and effective**, and it must be analyzed statistically (e.g., change in a communication score from before to after treatment).  
- **Outcome measures** focus on how a person **feels or functions**, such as communication, sleep, or activities of daily living; in Angelman syndrome, these are chosen to reflect what truly matters to families.  
- The community’s **PFDD (Patient-Focused Drug Development) survey** identified top treatment priorities (e.g., communication, understanding, daily functioning), and trials aim to align endpoints with these priorities.  
- A trial would avoid focusing on something families rate as low priority (like pain, if it’s not a major concern) and instead target outcomes like **communication effectiveness** or **comprehension**.  
- Biomarkers can sometimes also be endpoints (as surrogate endpoints), but they must be clearly linked to these patient-relevant outcomes.

## 4. EEG delta power as a biomarker in Angelman syndrome (human and mouse data)

- **EEG delta power** refers to the strength of brain waves in the **delta frequency band** (slow waves); in Angelman syndrome, delta power is **abnormally increased** during both sleep and wakefulness.  
- When comparing EEGs, individuals with Angelman (red line) show much higher delta power than neurotypical individuals (gray line), and this remains true across ages, even though delta power naturally declines with age in everyone.  
- Higher delta power is thought to reflect the **lack of UBE3A** and its impact on **synaptic function**, and deletion genotypes (typically more severe) show even higher delta power than non-deletion genotypes.  
- Analyses of natural history data suggest that **higher delta power is associated with lower cognitive function**, implying that if treatment can reduce delta power, cognitive abilities might improve.  
- In both **Angelman mouse models** and **human clinical trials with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)**, treatment has been shown to **reduce delta power**, and in humans this reduction has been accompanied by **improvements in cognition** (e.g., on the Bayley scales), supporting its potential as an efficacy biomarker.

## 5. MRI as a potential biomarker (brain volume and myelination)

- MRI studies show that individuals with Angelman syndrome have **delayed myelination** (slower development of the brain’s white matter insulation) and **slightly smaller brain volumes**, especially at younger ages.  
- In plots comparing Angelman individuals (circles) to neurotypical controls (triangles), the Angelman group tends to have **lower brain size measures** on average.  
- Because myelination and brain volume are measurable over time, MRI could potentially show whether **treatment helps the brain “catch up”** in myelination and growth.  
- This would provide a structural, visual marker of brain development that might correlate with functional gains (e.g., motor or cognitive improvements).  
- However, current knowledge is still limited, and more longitudinal data are needed to understand exactly how MRI changes relate to clinical outcomes in Angelman syndrome.

## 6. CSF and fluid biomarkers (UBE3A protein and protein signatures)

- Researchers are analyzing **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** from individuals with Angelman syndrome and neurotypical controls to measure **UBE3A protein** and other proteins.  
- A company called **SISCAPA** has developed a test that can detect UBE3A protein in CSF; early results show **normal UBE3A in neurotypicals** and **absent or greatly reduced UBE3A** in Angelman individuals, as expected.  
- If a treatment can **restore UBE3A protein levels** in CSF (from none to detectable), this would be a strong, early indicator of biological response—likely appearing **before** changes on clinical scales like Bayley, ORCA, or Vineland.  
- Another company, **SomaLogic**, is exploring broader **protein signatures** in CSF and has found patterns of proteins that differ between Angelman and neurotypical individuals, though the meaning and clinical correlations of these signatures are still being studied.  
- The long-term goal is to determine whether these protein changes **track with or predict** improvements in symptoms, making them powerful tools for early decision-making in trials.

## 7. Why Angelman biomarkers are not yet surrogate endpoints in trials

- Despite promising data on EEG, MRI, and CSF markers, they **do not yet meet regulatory standards** to be used as **primary surrogate endpoints** in Angelman clinical trials.  
- Regulators like the FDA require **robust, consistent evidence** that changes in a biomarker reliably predict meaningful changes in patient function or well-being.  
- Current phase 3 trials (e.g., by **Ultragenyx** and **Ionis**) still use **Bayley scale measures** as their **primary endpoints**, with biomarkers like delta power included as **supportive** measures.  
- More data from ongoing and future trials, plus natural history studies, are needed to firmly link biomarker changes to clinical outcomes.  
- Family participation—providing EEGs, MRIs, and CSF samples—is essential to building this evidence base and eventually elevating biomarkers to surrogate endpoint status.

## 8. How biomarkers can rescue or strengthen trials (ALS example with NFL)

- The ALS drug **tofersen** illustrates how biomarkers can be crucial even when a trial **fails its primary clinical endpoint**.  
- In its pivotal phase 3 trial, the main clinical rating scale (doctor-assessed ALS functional score) did not show a statistically significant benefit, partly due to variability in how clinicians scored patients.  
- However, the trial also measured **neurofilament light chain (NFL)**, a biomarker of **neuronal degeneration**, and prior work had established that higher NFL is linked to faster ALS progression.  
- In the tofersen data, patients who showed **reductions in NFL** also had the **best improvements in their ALS rating scores**, indicating a meaningful biological effect even though the primary endpoint was technically negative.  
- The FDA considered the **totality of evidence** and effectively approved the drug based on this **biomarker (NFL) as a surrogate**, demonstrating how strong biomarkers can “save” a program and show that a therapy is doing something important biologically.

## 9. How biomarkers can transform a disease area (MS and MRI lesions)

- In **multiple sclerosis (MS)**, advances in **MRI** allowed researchers to reliably measure **brain lesions** and link them to clinical outcomes like relapse frequency and disability progression.  
- By building large datasets correlating **number of lesions** with **relapse activity and functional decline**, they showed that if a treatment **reduces or eliminates lesions**, patients tend to have fewer relapses and better long-term outcomes.  
- This enabled **short, efficient trials** where companies could test drugs over a few months, look at MRI lesion changes, and quickly decide whether to invest further or move on.  
- As a result, MS experienced an explosion of therapeutic development, leading to **over 20 approved therapies**, largely driven by confidence in MRI as a meaningful biomarker.  
- The Angelman community aims for a similar future: investing in biomarkers now so that, eventually, they can **screen drugs faster**, prioritize the most promising ones, and accelerate the path to effective treatments.

## 10. Closing remarks and importance of family participation in biomarker research

- Even though Angelman biomarkers are not yet ready to serve as primary surrogate endpoints, they already **add crucial, objective evidence** that strengthens trial results and regulatory submissions.  
- The speaker emphasizes that **biomarker samples are hard to obtain** (especially CSF), and she expresses strong gratitude to families who participate and provide data.  
- These contributions are directly **shaping and enriching the development landscape**, making it possible to understand how treatments affect the brain and biology, not just behavior.  
- Continued participation in studies and natural history projects is essential to move biomarkers from “promising” to “regulatory-grade” tools.  
- The long-term payoff is a faster, more efficient path to effective therapies for Angelman syndrome, with better tools to decide what works and what does not.
