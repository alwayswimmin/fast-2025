**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents findings from a study of caregiver-reported “top concerns” for children and adults living with Angelman syndrome (AS), using data from the Angelman Syndrome Natural History Study at Boston Children’s Hospital. The research identifies the most common developmental, behavioral, medical, and other concerns, with expressive communication emerging as the most frequently reported issue, followed by externalizing behaviors and sleep. The goal is to use these caregiver perspectives to guide more targeted, person-centered care and highlight unmet needs in the AS community.

## 1. Background and aims of the project

- The project starts from the recognition that challenges in Angelman syndrome are highly variable and depend on both **age** and **molecular subtype** (e.g., deletion, mutation, UPD, imprinting defect). This means that what matters most to caregivers of a young child may differ from what matters to caregivers of an adult, and may also differ by genetic cause.  
- The team emphasizes that the **caregiver perspective** is essential for understanding real-world, day-to-day challenges that may not be fully captured by clinical tests or standard outcome measures.  
- The study has three main aims:  
  - Evaluate common **developmental, behavioral, medical, and other** concerns reported by caregivers.  
  - Identify **major concerns by age group and molecular subtype**.  
  - Use these concerns to highlight **unmet needs and gaps in care** in the AS community.  
- “Developmental” concerns might include communication, motor skills, or learning; “behavioral” concerns include things like aggression or self-injury; “medical” concerns include seizures, sleep, GI issues, etc.  
- By systematically collecting and analyzing these concerns, the researchers hope to inform **interventions, services, and policies** that are better aligned with what families actually need.

## 2. Methods: Data source and concern categorization

- Data came from the **Angelman Syndrome Natural History Study**, a longitudinal study where individuals with AS and their families attend **annual study visits**. At each visit, caregivers complete an **interview** where they are asked to list their **top three concerns** for their loved one with AS.  
- Caregivers can **rank** these concerns from 1 to 3, with **1 = greatest concern**, but the study also looks at concerns regardless of ranking. This allows the team to see both what is most urgent (rank 1) and what is common overall (any rank).  
- During data collection, concerns are recorded by the study team either into **pre-established categories** (e.g., “sleep,” “communication”) or as **free-text “other”** if they don’t fit existing categories.  
- After data collection, the researchers **recoded all free-text responses**, either fitting them into existing categories or creating **new categories** when needed, then **collapsed overlapping categories** to avoid redundancy.  
- This process resulted in **23 final concern categories**, which were then analyzed in two main ways:  
  - The **percentage of caregivers** who reported each concern (any rank).  
  - The **number one concern only**, further broken down by **age cohort** and **molecular subtype** (details shown on their poster).

## 3. Sample characteristics (age cohorts and molecular subtypes)

- The analysis included **193 unique participants** with Angelman syndrome from the Natural History Study. Each participant contributed caregiver-reported concerns from at least one study visit.  
- For analysis, the team divided participants into **four age cohorts** (exact age cutoffs not fully listed in the transcript, but one highlighted cohort is **6–12 years**). The **6–12 years** group was the **largest** cohort in the sample.  
- This age stratification allows the researchers to see how concerns **change across the lifespan**, for example, whether sleep is more prominent in younger children or whether behavioral issues become more prominent in adolescence.  
- For **molecular subtype**, the majority of participants were **deletion-positive**, which is typical in AS cohorts, followed by those with **UBE3A mutations**, and then those with **uniparental disomy (UPD)** and **imprinting defects**.  
- Analyzing by subtype is important because different genetic causes of AS can be associated with **different clinical profiles**, so caregiver concerns may cluster differently across these groups.

## 4. Overall results: Most frequently reported caregiver concerns

- The team created a graph showing the **percentage of caregivers** who endorsed each of the **23 concern categories**, regardless of ranking. Longer, darker bars on the graph represent **more frequently reported** concerns.  
- **Expressive communication** was clearly the **most commonly reported concern** in the entire sample. “Expressive communication” refers to the ability to **convey wants, needs, thoughts, and feelings** (e.g., using speech, signs, communication devices), not just understanding language.  
- The next most frequently reported concerns were **externalizing behaviors** and **sleep**:  
  - **Externalizing behaviors** include outwardly directed behaviors such as **hitting, slapping, or other forms of aggression or disruptive behavior**.  
  - **Sleep** concerns can include difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or maintaining a regular sleep pattern.  
- Although these three categories stood out, the researchers note that there was **representation of concerns across all domains**, meaning that families reported a wide range of developmental, behavioral, and medical issues.  
- The team also conducted more detailed analyses of **number one concerns by age and subtype**, but those results are presented on a **poster** rather than in this brief talk.

## 5. Key takeaways and implications for care

- **Expressive communication** emerged as the **top caregiver concern** by a wide margin, underscoring the central importance of communication support (e.g., speech therapy, augmentative and alternative communication devices, communication-focused interventions) for individuals with AS.  
- Identifying key concerns **across life stages** and **across genetic subtypes** supports a more **targeted, person-centered approach** to care—meaning services and interventions can be tailored to what is most pressing for a given age group or subtype.  
- The findings highlight that **caregiver voices are critical** for shaping research priorities, clinical care, and support services, ensuring that they address the **real-world needs** of families.  
- By mapping out common concerns and unmet needs, this work can inform **future treatments, clinical guidelines, and policy decisions**, such as funding for communication supports, behavioral services, and sleep management.  
- The speaker closes by acknowledging the **Angelman Biomarkers and Outcome Measures (ABOM) group**, the investigators and study teams involved in the Natural History Study, and especially the **families** whose participation made this research possible.
