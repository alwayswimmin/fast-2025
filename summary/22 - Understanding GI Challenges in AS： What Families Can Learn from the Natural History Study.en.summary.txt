**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents findings from the Angelman Syndrome (AS) Natural History Study focused on gastrointestinal (GI) challenges across the lifespan. Dr. Adriana Gomez explains how feeding difficulties, reflux, and especially constipation are highly prevalent in AS, how they differ by genetic subtype, how they are treated, and how they correlate with seizures. She also highlights a treatment gap and encourages families to participate in the study to improve understanding and care.

## 1. The Angelman Syndrome Natural History Study: structure and participation

- The Natural History Study is a long-term project started in 2004 to systematically collect clinical data on individuals with Angelman Syndrome over time. It currently includes **nine sites** across the **US and Canada**, making it a multi-center effort. Funding has come from major agencies (NIH, FDA) and is now supported by **Ebel**, which has allowed the study to continue and expand. Enrollment is described as “easy,” and families are encouraged to join by contacting study staff at the conference or through the participating sites. The core takeaway for families is that participation helps generate data that directly informs understanding of symptoms like GI issues and guides better care and future treatments.

## 2. GI symptoms in Angelman Syndrome across the lifespan

- GI symptoms are common and **start early in life**, then often **persist throughout the lifespan** in people with Angelman Syndrome. These symptoms include feeding difficulties in infancy, reflux (gastroesophageal reflux), constipation, gagging, drooling, and related issues. Dr. Gomez emphasizes that GI problems are not isolated; they can significantly affect **overall health**, including nutrition, growth, comfort, and possibly other domains like behavior and sleep. The study aims to track how these symptoms change over time and how they differ by **genetic subtype** (e.g., deletion vs. mutation). For families, this means that GI issues should be expected, monitored from infancy onward, and proactively managed as a chronic part of AS care.

## 3. Feeding difficulties and early-life growth concerns

- About **70% of children with the deletion subtype** of Angelman Syndrome have **feeding difficulties early in life**, which can be severe enough to cause **failure to gain weight**. “Feeding difficulties” can include poor suck, trouble coordinating swallowing, fatigue during feeds, or aversion to feeding, all of which can limit calorie intake. While the problem is more pronounced in the **deletion** group, children with **UBE3A mutations** also show “very important” difficulties gaining weight. This early feeding challenge has direct implications for growth, nutrition, and sometimes the need for interventions like specialized feeding strategies or feeding tubes. Families should work closely with pediatricians, nutritionists, and feeding specialists early on to monitor weight gain and intervene promptly.

## 4. Reflux: prevalence, subtypes, and common treatments

- **Reflux** (likely gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD) is another common GI issue and can begin early but continues into later life. In the **deletion** subgroup, up to **40%** of patients have some degree of reflux; other genetic subtypes show somewhat lower rates, but still around **one-third** of patients. Symptoms can include frequent spit-up or vomiting, discomfort after eating, arching, irritability, or feeding refusal. The most common treatments reported are **proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**, **H2 receptor antagonists**, and **antacids**, which reduce stomach acid and help relieve symptoms. Families should be aware that persistent irritability, poor sleep, or feeding refusal may be signs of reflux and should discuss evaluation and treatment options with their clinicians.

## 5. Constipation: prevalence, severity scoring, and treatment patterns

- Constipation is described as **“the biggest deal”** among GI problems in Angelman Syndrome, affecting about **70%** of patients in the study. The team developed a **constipation severity score** that considers:  
  1) **Frequency** of bowel movements per week,  
  2) **Consistency** of stools, and  
  3) **Number of medications** needed to manage it.  
- Based on this scoring, constipation is classified as **mild, moderate, or severe**, with **most children** falling into the **moderate** category. About **50%** of patients are taking **some medication** for constipation, including stimulant laxatives, osmotic laxatives, and dietary supplements such as **fiber** or **magnesium**. For families, this means constipation should be routinely assessed (how often, how hard, how much help is needed) and treated proactively, not just when it becomes extreme.

## 6. Treatment gap and possible barriers in managing constipation

- Although **70–80%** of individuals with Angelman Syndrome have constipation, only about **50%** are receiving treatment for it. This discrepancy suggests a **treatment gap**: many children and adults with significant constipation may not be adequately managed. Dr. Gomez raises the question of whether there are **barriers**—such as under-recognition by providers, normalization of symptoms (“this is just how it is”), lack of access to GI specialists, or concerns about long-term medication use. Untreated constipation can worsen discomfort, behavior, appetite, and possibly seizure control, so it is not a minor issue. Families are encouraged to bring up constipation explicitly with their clinicians and advocate for consistent management plans (diet, fluids, medications, and monitoring).

## 7. Correlation between GI symptoms and seizures

- The study has found a **clear correlation** between the **presence of GI symptoms** and a **higher prevalence of seizures**. Among individuals with reported GI symptoms (such as reflux, gagging, drooling), **53–100%** also have seizures, whereas those **without** GI symptoms have a **much lower** seizure prevalence. Dr. Gomez stresses that **correlation is not causation**: this does not prove that GI problems cause seizures, only that they tend to occur together more often. The team’s long-term goal is to also examine how GI symptoms relate to **behavior** and **sleep**, but that analysis is still in progress. For families, this suggests that careful management of GI issues may be an important part of overall neurological care, even if we do not yet know the exact causal pathways.

## 8. Seizure control and anti-seizure medications in the cohort

- When the team looked at seizure severity in the recent past, about **90%** of patients had **no severe seizures in the last four weeks**, indicating that most are **well controlled** on their current regimens. The talk briefly notes that a variety of **anti-seizure medications** are being used, though specific drugs are not detailed in the excerpt. This level of control is encouraging and suggests that, despite high seizure prevalence, many individuals can achieve good seizure management. The interplay between seizure control and GI symptoms remains an active area of study, with the hope that better understanding will refine treatment strategies. Families should continue to work with neurologists to optimize seizure control while also addressing GI issues as part of a comprehensive care plan.
