**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk describes how Helix, a clinical-stage biotech company, uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to identify existing, approved drugs that can be repurposed to treat Angelman syndrome. Dr. Wayne Chadwick explains how an initial lead compound (0553) had to be abandoned for technical reasons, and how AI-guided screening led to three new candidate drugs (Helix A, B, and C) that improved neuronal structure and behavior in Angelman mouse models. Two of these candidates, especially a “shelved” phase 3 asset (Helix B) and a prescription drug (Helix C), now look promising for relatively rapid transition into clinical trials.

### 1. Helix’s AI-driven drug repurposing approach

- Helix uses **artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning** to predict which already-approved drugs might be effective for rare diseases such as Angelman syndrome.  
- This strategy is called **drug repurposing (or repositioning)**: taking a drug approved for one condition and using it to treat a different disease.  
- Their algorithms analyze large datasets to match disease biology with drug mechanisms, yielding a **~50% “hit rate”** (about half of predicted drugs show meaningful activity in their disease models).  
- For each rare disease, Helix typically uncovers **1–5 novel mechanisms of action**, including for Angelman syndrome, which can reveal new biological pathways to target.  
- Because the drugs are already on the market or have prior clinical data, this approach can **shorten the path from discovery to human trials**, especially important in rare diseases.

### 2. The initial Angelman candidate 0553 and why it was abandoned

- Helix’s first lead for Angelman syndrome was a repurposed drug called **0553**, originally approved for another indication.  
- In mouse models of Angelman syndrome, 0553 was **highly potent** and improved multiple symptoms (phenotypes), making it a very promising candidate.  
- However, 0553 was designed for **short-term use**, and its **physicochemical properties** (its chemical structure and stability) made it unsuitable for **long-term, chronic dosing** needed in Angelman.  
- Attempts to fix this via **reformulation**—changing how the drug is absorbed and distributed—failed because the compound was **not stable when dosed in animals**.  
- Despite abandoning 0553 itself, Helix remained confident in the **underlying mechanism** that produced the benefits, and decided to search for other drugs with the same mechanism but better properties.

### 3. Designing an in vitro screen using Angelman mouse neurons

- To compare alternative drugs with the same mechanism as 0553, Helix needed an **in vitro assay** (a test done in cells in a dish rather than in live animals).  
- They used **neurons from Angelman mouse models**, which have a **distinct abnormal morphology**, especially in their **dendritic spines**.  
- **Dendritic spines** are small protrusions on neuron branches where synapses form; they are crucial for **neuron-to-neuron communication** and learning.  
- In Angelman neurons (mouse and human), there are **fewer dendritic spines**, and most are **immature**, with very few mature spines, which impairs effective communication.  
- Previous work showed that 0553 could **increase dendritic spine number and promote maturation**, making Angelman neurons look morphologically like healthy neurons, so this became the **benchmark** for testing new candidates.

### 4. Identification and triage of 18 mechanism-related drugs to three leads (Helix A, B, C)

- Helix identified **18 drugs** that shared the **same or similar mechanism** as 0553 and tested them in the dendritic spine assay.  
- **Ten** of these drugs were **highly potent**, performing as well as 0553 in improving dendritic spine features.  
- They then **triaged** these 10 drugs based on:  
  - Suitability for **chronic use**  
  - **Brain penetration** (whether they reach high enough concentrations in the brain)  
  - **Reformulation feasibility** and **commercial potential**  
- From this process, they selected **three lead drugs**, referred to as **Helix A, Helix B, and Helix C**, for deeper investigation.  
- The three leads included:  
  - An **active metabolite** of an existing marketed drug  
  - A **“shelved asset”** (a drug that reached phase 3 for another indication but was dropped for commercial, not safety, reasons)  
  - A **prescription-only drug** already on the market

### 5. In vitro results: dendritic spine number and maturation

- All three lead drugs (Helix A, B, and C) were tested in the **dendritic spine assay** using Angelman mouse neurons.  
- Each of the three drugs **increased the number of dendritic spines** in Angelman neurons.  
- They also **promoted maturation** of these spines, shifting them from immature to mature forms associated with effective synaptic communication.  
- After treatment, the **morphology of Angelman neurons became essentially indistinguishable from healthy neurons**, at least in terms of dendritic spine structure.  
- This suggests that these drugs can **restore structural features needed for better neuronal communication**, a key step before testing behavior in animals.

### 6. In vivo behavioral testing in Angelman mice

- The three drugs were then tested **in vivo** (in live Angelman mice) by dosing the animals for about **two weeks** before behavioral testing.  
- A **battery of behavioral tests** was used to assess different symptom domains:  
  - **Open field test** for mobility (distance moved)  
  - **Marble burying** for motor function and possibly repetitive/goal-directed behavior  
  - **Grip strength** for muscle strength  
  - **Clasping** for motor control abnormalities  
  - **Rotarod** for balance, coordination, and **motor learning** (how performance improves over days)  
  - **Object recognition test** for **cognition** and recognition memory  
- In the graphs, **white bars** represented healthy mice (the target outcome), and **gray bars** represented untreated Angelman mice (the impaired baseline).  
- The goal was to see whether drug-treated Angelman mice could **shift from the gray (untreated) profile toward the white (healthy) profile** across these tests.  
- This comprehensive approach allowed Helix to see which drugs improved which specific behavioral deficits.

### 7. Comparative performance of Helix A, B, and C

- In the **open field test**, Helix B and Helix C **increased mobility** of Angelman mice to levels close to healthy animals, while Helix A was **less effective**.  
- In **marble burying**, all three drugs significantly improved performance compared to untreated Angelman mice, with Helix B and C again outperforming Helix A.  
- None of the drugs improved **grip strength**, but all three improved **motor control** as measured by reduced abnormal clasping, with Helix B and C restoring motor control to near-healthy levels.  
- In the **rotarod assay**, all three drugs improved **balance and coordination** on day 1, but Helix B and C made the mice **indistinguishable from healthy animals**; across days 2–5, Helix B and C also showed **improved motor learning**, while Helix A lagged behind.  
- In the **object recognition test**, all three drugs improved **cognition**, enabling treated Angelman mice to distinguish between two objects, indicating better recognition memory.

### 8. Clinical potential, reformulation work, and next steps

- **Helix B** (the shelved phase 3 asset) and **Helix C** (the prescription drug) were able to **restore motor control, coordination, and memory** in Angelman mice to levels comparable to healthy animals.  
- Helix B is particularly attractive because it is **already suitable for chronic use** and does **not require reformulation**, which could allow **faster transition into clinical trials**.  
- Helix A and C **do require reformulation**, but Helix reports that reformulation work has already begun, is **stable**, and has led to **higher drug levels in the mouse brain**, which may translate into better efficacy, especially for Helix A.  
- Helix aims to be **close to entering the clinic by sometime next year**, though this depends on **licensing negotiations** with the owner of the shelved asset (Helix B).  
- As the moderator notes, these are **downstream, symptom-targeting approaches** (not direct UBE3A replacement), and because they involve **repurposed drugs with existing safety data**, they may allow a **faster move from mouse to human** compared with entirely new compounds.
