## 1. Ionis Pharmaceuticals and its neurology/RNA‑targeted background

- Ionis was founded about 35 years ago with a focus on **RNA‑targeted medicines**, particularly antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which are short synthetic strands of nucleic acid designed to bind specific RNA targets.  
- The company has grown to over 1,100 employees, including some who have been there since its founding, and has a strong track record of scientific innovation.  
- In neurology, Ionis has **three approved medicines**: Spinraza (for spinal muscular atrophy), Qalsody/Kelsadi (for SOD1 ALS), and Wainua/Wayua (for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin‑mediated amyloidosis).  
- Beyond these, Ionis has multiple neurology programs in clinical development, including ION‑582 for Angelman syndrome.  
- This long experience with ASOs and CNS delivery is the technical foundation for the Angelman program.

---

## 2. Collaboration with the Angelman community and research partners

- From the beginning of the Angelman program, Ionis has **actively collaborated with families, advocacy groups, clinicians, and researchers** to understand the disease and design trials.  
- Early on, they supported **natural history studies** and research consortia to better characterize how Angelman syndrome progresses over time without treatment.  
- Ionis participates in conferences, community advisory meetings, and global Angelman syndrome advisory boards to gather feedback and align trial design with real-world needs.  
- This collaboration has influenced everything from **eligibility criteria** to **choice of endpoints** and **visit schedules**, aiming to make trials both scientifically robust and family‑feasible.  
- The company explicitly credits the community, including HALOS and REVEAL participants and their caregivers, as essential to making the program possible.

## 3. Scientific rationale and development path for ION‑582

- The development of ION‑582 began with identifying a **biological target** that could restore UBE3A function in Angelman syndrome.  
- Ionis collaborated with Dr. Scott Dindot/Boddaert (referred to as Dr. Boddet in the talk) and other Angelman experts to discover a mechanism to **upregulate UBE3A using an ASO**.  
- Preclinical proof‑of‑concept studies in **Angelman disease models** showed that an ASO targeting the UBE3A antisense transcript could provide benefit, supporting further development.  
- Ionis then used its decades of ASO experience to **screen multiple candidate molecules** and selected ION‑582 as the lead candidate for clinical testing.  
- Parallel to this, they worked on **biomarkers and outcome measures** (e.g., EEG, developmental scales) to track disease trajectory and treatment effects in trials.

---

## 4. Mechanism of action of ION‑582 in Angelman syndrome

- In Angelman syndrome, the **maternal copy of the UBE3A gene** (from the mother) is missing or nonfunctional (due to deletion or mutation), while the **paternal copy** (from the father) is present but **silenced** in neurons.  
- The paternal UBE3A is silenced by a long **antisense RNA transcript** (UBE3A‑ATS) that runs across the gene and prevents it from being expressed.  
- ION‑582 is an **antisense oligonucleotide** designed to bind specifically to this antisense transcript and **reduce or block it**, a process often called “unsilencing” the paternal allele.  
- By inhibiting UBE3A‑ATS, ION‑582 aims to allow the paternal UBE3A gene to produce **UBE3A protein**, potentially compensating for the missing maternal gene.  
- This strategy is **genotype‑agnostic** for those with maternal deletions or mutations, because it targets the shared mechanism of paternal silencing rather than the specific maternal mutation.

## 5. Overview of the HALOS Phase 1/2 clinical trial program

- **HALOS** is a global, **open‑label Phase 1/2 study** of ION‑582 in individuals with Angelman syndrome, designed primarily to evaluate **safety and tolerability**, with exploratory measures of efficacy.  
- It includes **55 participants** aged **2 to 50 years** with either **deletion or mutation** genotypes of UBE3A.  
- The **multiple ascending dose (MAD)** portion tested three doses: **20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg**, given every 12 weeks; this part is now complete.  
- After MAD, participants could enter a **long‑term extension (LTE)** where they receive either **40 mg or 80 mg** every 12 weeks for up to **four additional years**.  
- HALOS was not statistically powered or designed to prove efficacy, but the **encouraging results** from HALOS form the basis for the Phase 3 REVEAL trial.

---

## 6. Under‑2 cohort in HALOS (very young participants)

- Ionis amended the HALOS protocol to include **participants under 2 years of age**, reflecting interest in **earlier intervention**.  
- Up to **15 participants** with deletion or mutation genotypes can enroll in this under‑2 cohort.  
- This part of HALOS is also **open‑label**, with all participants receiving ION‑582 every 12 weeks for approximately **four years**.  
- The **first under‑2 participant was dosed in September**, marking an important milestone in testing the therapy in very young children.  
- Enrollment for this cohort is ongoing at sites in the **US, EU, and Israel**.

## 7. Bayley‑4 expressive communication: what it measures and why it matters

- The **Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, 4th Edition (Bayley‑4)** is a standardized assessment used to evaluate developmental domains in young children, but it can be adapted for older individuals with developmental delays.  
- It measures several domains: **language/communication** (expressive and receptive), **cognition** (learning, memory, concept formation), and **motor skills** (fine and gross motor).  
- **Expressive communication** specifically evaluates how a child **communicates with others**—using sounds, gestures, words, and other behaviors to express needs, interests, and intentions.  
- During the assessment, a clinician interacts with the child (talking, playing) and observes how the child uses gestures, vocalizations, or other means to get attention or show understanding of communication.  
- Scores can be converted to **Growth Scale Values (GSVs)**, which allow clinicians to track **change over time** in a child’s communication abilities, even if they remain far below age‑typical levels.

---

## 8. HALOS expressive communication results (Bayley‑4 data)

- In the HALOS long‑term extension, ION‑582‑treated participants (40 mg and 80 mg) showed **continued improvement in expressive communication** on the Bayley‑4 through **18 months**, across **all ages and genotypes**.  
- The analysis compared the **mean change from baseline** in expressive communication GSV scores for HALOS participants (pink line) with a **natural history cohort** (typical trajectory for Angelman without treatment).  
- The ION‑582 groups at **40 mg and 80 mg** showed **greater improvements than natural history**, suggesting a treatment‑associated benefit beyond expected developmental gains.  
- These data are **exploratory** (open‑label, no placebo control) but are considered **encouraging** and support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial focused on expressive communication.  
- The 40 mg and 80 mg doses are **pooled** in the presented analysis, and both appear to contribute to the observed improvements.

## 9. EEG and delta power as a biomarker; HALOS EEG findings

- An **EEG (electroencephalogram)** is a non‑invasive test where electrodes on the scalp record the brain’s electrical activity; it is safe and commonly used in neurology.  
- In Angelman syndrome, EEGs are typically **abnormal**, with **increased delta power** (slow‑wave activity) when awake compared to neurotypical individuals; higher delta power has been linked to **worse cognitive function**.  
- Because of this, **delta power** is being explored as a **biomarker** of disease severity and potential treatment response in Angelman clinical trials.  
- In HALOS, ION‑582 at **40 mg and 80 mg** produced **robust suppression of delta power** at month 6, while the **20 mg dose showed no meaningful effect**, which is why 20 mg was not carried into the LTE.  
- The 40 mg and 80 mg groups showed **similar reductions** in delta power, suggesting that both doses reach a biologically active range for modulating brain activity.

---

## 10. Overall conclusions from HALOS and publication plans

- Participants in HALOS have now received ION‑582 for an **average of about two years**, with some up to **three years**, providing valuable **long‑term safety and exploratory efficacy data**.  
- The EEG data show **consistent delta power reduction** at both 40 mg and 80 mg, supporting a biological effect on brain function.  
- The Bayley‑4 expressive communication data show **improvements through 18 months** in both children and adults at 40 mg and 80 mg, exceeding natural history trajectories.  
- These findings, while not definitive efficacy proof, **support the dose selection and design** of the REVEAL Phase 3 trial.  
- Ionis plans to **publish the 18‑month HALOS data next year**, making the results available to the broader scientific and clinical community.

---

## 11. Design and objectives of the REVEAL Phase 3 trial

- **REVEAL** is a **global, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled Phase 3 trial** designed to demonstrate the **safety and efficacy** of ION‑582 in children and adults with Angelman syndrome.  
- It includes participants aged **2 to 50 years** with **deletion or mutation** genotypes of UBE3A, mirroring the HALOS population.  
- Participants receive **doses every three months** (every 12 weeks) of either ION‑582 or placebo during the double‑blind period.  
- The **primary objective** is to assess whether ION‑582 improves **expressive communication**, measured by the Bayley‑4 expressive communication domain.  
- Secondary objectives include effects on **cognition (learning and memory), receptive communication, overall disease severity, sleep problems, motor function, and daily living skills**, along with comprehensive safety monitoring by investigators and an independent safety board.

---

## 12. Role of caregiver/community input in endpoint selection

- Ionis used feedback from families, advocacy groups (FAST, ASF), and surveys such as the **Angelman Syndrome externally led PFDD meeting** and the **Hope and Action survey** to guide endpoint selection.  
- In these surveys, **communication** emerged as one of the **top symptom domains** with the greatest impact on individuals with Angelman syndrome and their families.  
- Based on this, **expressive communication** was chosen as the **primary endpoint** in REVEAL, aligning the trial’s main outcome with what families say matters most.  
- Additional secondary endpoints were selected to cover other high‑impact domains (sleep, motor, daily living, overall severity) to capture the **totality of treatment effects**.  
- Ionis also uses **caregiver advisory boards** to refine trial procedures and ensure that study demands are as manageable and meaningful as possible for families.

---

## 13. What participation in REVEAL looks like (visits, dosing, duration)

- Participation begins with a **screening period**, during which eligibility criteria are assessed to determine if the individual can enroll.  
- In the **double‑blind treatment period**, participants receive **five doses** of either ION‑582 or placebo over about **18 months**, with **nine in‑person clinic visits** during screening plus this period.  
- Key assessments (e.g., Bayley‑4, other outcome measures) are performed approximately **every six months** during this phase.  
- After completing the double‑blind period, participants **seamlessly transition** into a **two‑year long‑term extension**, where **all participants receive ION‑582** (no placebo), with **nine additional doses** and **14 in‑person visits** across the LTE and follow‑up.  
- The total trial duration is about **3.5 years**, including the double‑blind phase, LTE, and an **~8‑month follow‑up** period.

---

## 14. Planned Phase 3 CHAMPION study for UPD/imprinting defect genotypes

- Ionis announced plans to start a **Phase 3 study** specifically for individuals with Angelman syndrome due to **uniparental disomy (UPD)** or **imprinting defects (ID)**, genotypes not included in the current REVEAL trial.  
- This new study will be called **CHAMPION** and is planned to begin **next year**.  
- CHAMPION will include **children and adults** with UPD or ID, expanding access to ION‑582 trials to **all major Angelman genotypes**.  
- The decision to initiate CHAMPION reflects **strong community advocacy** for inclusive trials that do not leave out specific genetic subgroups.  
- Community leaders highlighted this as a major step forward, noting that sponsors have “heard us loud and clear” about the need to include all genotypes.

## 15. Final summary and implications for the Angelman community

- The **REVEAL Phase 3 trial** is actively enrolling globally and is on track to **complete enrollment next year**, representing a pivotal step toward potential approval of ION‑582.  
- The **HALOS Phase 1/2 study** continues to provide **long‑term safety and exploratory efficacy data**, including in very young children under 2 years of age.  
- The planned **CHAMPION Phase 3 trial** for UPD/ID genotypes will broaden the program’s reach and address a long‑standing community priority for genotype‑inclusive research.  
- Across all studies, Ionis is integrating **family and caregiver input** into trial design, endpoints, and logistics to ensure that outcomes are meaningful and participation is feasible.  
- Overall, the program reflects a maturing therapeutic pipeline for Angelman syndrome, with multiple late‑stage trials and a strong emphasis on communication, quality of life, and inclusion of all genetic subtypes.
