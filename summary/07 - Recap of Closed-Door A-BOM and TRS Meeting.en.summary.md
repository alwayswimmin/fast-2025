## 1. Purpose and structure of the A‑BOM Consortium

- The A‑BOM (Angelman Biomarker and Outcome Measure) Consortium’s core goal is to identify, develop, and validate **drug development tools**—outcome measures and biomarkers—that can be used in clinical trials and accepted by regulators. Outcome measures are tools/tests that show whether a treatment changes symptoms in a meaningful way; biomarkers are measurable biological indicators (e.g., proteins in blood or CSF) that reflect disease or treatment effects.  
- A‑BOM brings together academics, clinicians, industry, and advocates to reach **consensus** on *what* to measure and *how* to measure it in Angelman syndrome, across ages and genotypes. Consensus is crucial because regulators gain confidence when the field is aligned rather than fragmented.  
- The consortium also **maps gaps** in existing tools and decides when to create new ones, as they did with the ORCA communication measure for nonverbal individuals.  
- A‑BOM emphasizes **rigor and “fit-for-purpose”**: tools must be scientifically sound and appropriate for Angelman syndrome, not just borrowed from other conditions.  
- A defining principle is **sharing**: members are expected not to silo data or methods, because open sharing accelerates progress for the entire community and makes the regulatory case stronger.

## 2. Natural history studies and their regulatory importance

- Natural history studies systematically track how Angelman syndrome progresses over time without experimental treatment, across many individuals and sites. The long-running Boston Children’s/Raidiès study (since 2006) is a central example, originally funded by NIH, then FDA, and more recently by A‑BOM members.  
- These data show regulators **“what usually happens”** in Angelman syndrome, so they can compare treated vs. untreated trajectories and see if a drug truly changes the course of symptoms. Regulators do not accept “clinical impressions” alone; they want quantitative proof that outcomes differ from well-documented natural history.  
- The U.S. study has inspired and been complemented by additional natural history efforts in the UK, Belgium, Latin America, and Spain, creating a more global picture.  
- A‑BOM’s financial support and strategic use of these data underscore that **clinical trial readiness** is as important as basic science (cell lines, organoids, animal models).  
- If companies believe there is no reliable way to measure change in Angelman syndrome, they may avoid investing in trials; robust natural history and outcome tools counter that barrier.

## 3. Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD) meeting and “Voice of the Patient” report

- The PFDD meeting in April was a major event where families described their lived experience with Angelman syndrome, treatment priorities, and what meaningful change looks like. This led to a **Voice of the Patient** report, now published on the FDA website and on FAST/ASF sites.  
- The report documents which symptoms matter most, how they affect daily life, and what improvements families hope to see; regulators are expected to consider this in their **benefit–risk decisions** for future therapies.  
- FDA feedback after the meeting indicated that some testimonies were “hard to hear” and eye-opening, deepening their understanding of how devastating the condition can be for families. Nearly 50 FDA staff attended or participated virtually, showing strong regulatory interest.  
- The PFDD findings also guide A‑BOM’s priorities: they focus more effort on measures that align with what families said is most important (e.g., communication, sleep, behavior).  
- This process ensures that **patient-focused drug development** is not just a slogan but a concrete input into trial design, endpoint selection, and regulatory review.

## 4. Community attitudes toward gene therapy risks and benefits

- Following the PFDD meeting, FDA specifically asked A‑BOM to better understand how the Angelman community thinks about **gene therapy**—its potential benefits, risks, and uncertainties.  
- A‑BOM conducted focus groups to explore questions such as: What safety issues worry you? What level of benefit would you need to see? What information and format (e.g., written materials, doctor discussions) do you need to make an informed decision about trial participation?  
- Regulators recognize that in rare diseases families often feel “willing to do anything,” but they also know that when concrete risk information is presented, some families may reconsider; they want to understand that **real decision-making process**.  
- The goal is to design trials and educational materials that are transparent, understandable, and respectful of families’ values and risk tolerance, rather than assuming a blanket willingness.  
- These insights will inform how future gene therapy trials are communicated and consented, and how regulators weigh community perspectives in their benefit–risk assessments.

## 5. Development and use of the ORCA communication measure

- ORCA (Observer-Reported Communication Abilities) is a caregiver-reported tool developed to assess communication in individuals with Angelman syndrome, especially those who are nonverbal. It arose after FDA indicated that existing communication assessments were not well-suited to this population.  
- A‑BOM, working with Duke University and the community, created ORCA through surveys and iterative feedback from caregivers who know their child’s communication best.  
- At the meeting, a panel of five mothers discussed how their children communicate, how they experienced the ORCA survey, and what different **ORCA scores** mean in real life. For example, they reflected on what a given score (e.g., 50) corresponds to in terms of actual abilities and what size of score change would feel meaningful.  
- This caregiver input helps define **“meaningful change”** on the scale (e.g., is a 2‑point change noticeable? Is 4 points life-changing?), which is critical for interpreting trial results and for regulators deciding if a drug’s effect is clinically important.  
- ORCA exemplifies A‑BOM’s approach: identify a gap, co-develop a rigorous tool with families and experts, and then anchor its scoring to real-world impact.

## 6. Understanding anxiety and challenging behaviors in Angelman syndrome

- FDA asked A‑BOM to dig deeper into **anxiety and challenging behaviors**, because families highlighted these issues strongly in PFDD surveys and testimonies. The question is: what exactly is “anxiety” in Angelman syndrome, and how does it show up day-to-day?  
- A‑BOM analyzed nearly 1,700 written responses from the PFDD pre-meeting survey, where caregivers ranked treatment priorities and described what meaningful change would look like. They examined whether “anxiety” in practice refers to aggression, hitting, impulsivity, distress in certain situations, or other behaviors.  
- This detailed analysis helps **tease apart concepts**—distinguishing anxiety from other challenging behaviors—so that future measures and trials can target and capture the right things.  
- An FDA representative participated in this discussion, offering input on how such constructs might be measured in a way that regulators can understand and accept.  
- A key takeaway was that **small behavioral improvements** (e.g., fewer outbursts, less impulsivity) can have a large impact on family life, which should be reflected in how outcomes and “meaningful change” are defined.

## 7. Sleep and cognition as treatment priorities and trial outcomes

- Sleep and cognition emerged as major domains of concern and priority in the PFDD work, and A‑BOM invited teams from Rush and Boston Children’s to present what they have learned about these areas.  
- For sleep, families emphasized outcomes such as longer total sleep time, fewer night awakenings, and reduced need for sleep medications; these are concrete, trackable changes that matter to both the child and the family.  
- A‑BOM also explicitly considers **family impact**: for example, if a child’s sleep improves, parents’ sleep and overall functioning often improve as well, which is an important part of the treatment benefit.  
- For cognition, the focus is on how to measure meaningful changes in learning, understanding, and daily functioning in a population with significant developmental challenges.  
- These insights are being used to refine which sleep and cognitive measures are best suited for clinical trials and how to interpret changes in a way that aligns with caregiver priorities.

## 8. Translational Research Symposium: goals, format, and culture of sharing

- The Translational Research Symposium is a separate but linked event where scientists, clinicians, and industry can present **cutting-edge, highly technical research** without needing to simplify for a general audience. This allows them to move quickly and focus on conclusions and implications.  
- The format included 10 “lightning” scientific talks and over 30 posters, with more than 150 attendees from research, clinical practice, industry, and regulatory bodies. Lightning talks are very short, high-density presentations that skip basic background and go straight to new data and conclusions.  
- The symposium’s purpose is to **foster collaboration and problem-solving**: labs share both positive and negative results so others can learn, avoid duplication, and improve their own work.  
- There is an explicit culture of being open about **failures**—if a strategy doesn’t work, it is presented and discussed so others can either rescue the idea or decide to stop pursuing it, saving time and resources.  
- This environment is designed to move the field closer to **transformative therapies** by encouraging novel ideas, cross-lab learning, and honest assessment of what is and isn’t working.

## 9. Key scientific highlights from the Translational Research Symposium

- **CRISPR-Cas13 gene editing program (Dave Segal):** After several years of support, the team concluded this approach did not show enough advantage over other strategies and made a **“no-go” decision** to stop advancing it. This is an example of transparent sharing of negative/neutral results.  
- **Zinc finger (ZF) program:** In contrast, ZF-based approaches to knock down antisense transcripts and upregulate the UBE3A gene are looking promising, with potential human drug candidates emerging. This strategy aims to restore UBE3A expression in neurons, a central therapeutic goal in Angelman syndrome.  
- **Beyond UBE3A in deletions (Eric Levine):** Research is examining the role of other genes lost in deletion genotypes and how their upregulation or modulation might affect outcomes, broadening the therapeutic and biomarker landscape beyond UBE3A alone.  
- **Autophagy and brain health (Alvin Wang, Brown University):** Work on autophagy (the cell’s “recycling” and cleanup system) suggests that certain drugs may improve neuronal function by enhancing autophagy, offering another potential treatment angle.  
- **New assays and biomarkers:** A North Carolina State team presented a **ubiquitination assay** to measure UBE3A protein function, useful for evaluating gene or protein therapies. Multiple groups are also working on detecting UBE3A in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a potential **biomarker of target engagement**, which could show whether a therapy is actually increasing UBE3A in the brain.

## 10. Overall conclusions: patient-focused drug development and collaboration

- Across A‑BOM and the Translational Research Symposium, the unifying theme is **patient-focused drug development**: everything—from outcome measures to biomarkers to trial design—is being shaped by what is meaningful and measurable for people with Angelman syndrome and their families.  
- Regulatory engagement is strong and ongoing: FDA and other agencies are being kept closely informed, and their feedback (e.g., on communication measures, anxiety, gene therapy attitudes) is directly influencing the field’s priorities.  
- Industry, academia, and advocacy groups are working together in a coordinated way, with expectations of **data sharing and transparency**, including around negative results.  
- The meetings demonstrated that the community is building a robust framework for **clinical trial readiness**: validated tools, natural history data, clear patient priorities, and emerging biomarkers.  
- The speakers closed by emphasizing that all of this work is ultimately for the children and adults living with Angelman syndrome, and that keeping their needs at the center is the only way to truly transform their lives.
