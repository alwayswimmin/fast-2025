**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This keynote describes how hematopoietic (blood-forming) stem cell gene therapy works, its proven success in curing certain genetic diseases, and how the same strategy is now being adapted for Angelman syndrome. The speaker explains the biology of blood stem cells, the engineering of safe viral vectors, long-term clinical outcomes in immune deficiency, and the preclinical data showing full rescue of Angelman-like symptoms in mice. He closes with realistic discussion of risks, logistics, and the path toward a first-in-human clinical trial.

## 1. Basics of blood and hematopoietic stem cells

- Blood contains red blood cells (carry oxygen via hemoglobin), various white blood cells (immune cells), and platelets (clotting), all of which arise from **hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)** in the bone marrow.  
- HSCs are “baby” cells that can self-renew for life and differentiate into all blood and immune cell types; intermediate “teenager” progenitors expand rapidly, and mature “adult” cells perform specific functions but do not self-renew long-term.  
- A key surface marker used to enrich for human HSCs is **CD34**; clinical processing often involves selecting CD34⁺ cells to target the true stem and early progenitor population.  
- HSCs can be collected from: bone marrow (needle aspiration from pelvic bone), umbilical cord blood at birth, or **mobilized peripheral blood**, where drugs push stem cells from marrow into the bloodstream for collection by apheresis.  
- Because HSCs are long-lived and self-renewing, successfully modifying them genetically can lead to **lifelong production** of corrected blood and immune cells.

## 2. Clinical uses of bone marrow / hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

- Bone marrow / HSC transplantation has been used for over 50 years, primarily to treat **cancers such as leukemia**, where high-dose chemotherapy wipes out diseased marrow and transplanted HSCs “rescue” blood formation.  
- Other uses include treating **bone marrow failure** (e.g., aplastic anemia) and **inherited genetic diseases** of blood or blood-related cells (e.g., sickle cell disease, immune deficiencies, metabolic disorders).  
- In genetic diseases, the principle is to replace the patient’s defective HSCs with normal ones—either from a donor or, in gene therapy, by correcting the patient’s own cells.  
- Many genetic conditions have been cured or significantly improved by HSC transplantation, including immune deficiencies (e.g., SCID), hemoglobin disorders, and several metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases.  
- For Angelman syndrome, the idea is analogous to other neuro-metabolic diseases (e.g., X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, metachromatic leukodystrophy, MPS disorders), where donor-derived cells enter the brain and supply a missing protein.

## 3. Overview of gene therapy: in vivo vs ex vivo and delivery tools

- **Gene therapy** aims to treat disease by adding, fixing, or modulating genes; it can be divided into:
  - **In vivo**: delivering genetic material directly into the body (e.g., AAV vectors into eye, brain, liver; CRISPR components; antisense oligonucleotides/ASOs).  
  - **Ex vivo**: removing cells, modifying them in the lab, then reinfusing them—currently feasible mainly for blood cells (HSCs and T cells).  
- The first FDA-approved gene therapy in the U.S. was an in vivo AAV treatment for a retinal disease, restoring vision by delivering a missing gene to retinal cells.  
- New delivery platforms like **lipid nanoparticles** (used in mRNA COVID vaccines) are being adapted to carry gene-editing tools (e.g., CRISPR) to specific tissues.  
- All these approaches target **somatic cells** (body cells), not germline cells (sperm/egg), because permanent changes to the human gene pool are not ethically or scientifically acceptable at this time.  
- Regulatory approval requires demonstrating that gene therapies do not affect germ cells and that the genetic changes remain confined to the intended tissues.

## 4. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy: concept and workflow

- **Autologous HSC gene therapy** uses the patient’s own stem cells as their “own donor,” eliminating the need to find a matched donor and avoiding graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  
- The workflow: collect HSCs (usually via mobilized peripheral blood), enrich CD34⁺ cells, genetically modify them ex vivo (either by adding a gene with a viral vector or editing with CRISPR), then reinfuse them after conditioning chemotherapy.  
- The key engineering challenge is to ensure the therapeutic gene is inserted into **true long-term HSCs**, because only those cells will sustain correction for the patient’s lifetime.  
- For adding genes, **integrating viral vectors** (especially lentiviral vectors) are used so that the new gene becomes part of the cell’s DNA and is passed to all daughter cells; non-integrating vectors like AAV would be diluted out as cells divide.  
- The actual transplant is technically simple: after conditioning, the modified cells are thawed and infused intravenously like a blood transfusion; they home to the bone marrow and engraft.

## 5. Conditioning (chemotherapy) and its risks

- **Conditioning** is chemotherapy given before reinfusion of modified HSCs to create “space” in the bone marrow so the new cells can engraft; without it, engraftment is minimal.  
- Full myeloablative conditioning (e.g., with **busulfan**) wipes out most native marrow, allowing near-complete replacement by gene-corrected cells; reduced-intensity regimens open only partial space.  
- Busulfan is typically given over 3–4 days; patients often feel relatively well during dosing, but side effects emerge over the following weeks: mouth and gut mucositis (painful sores, difficulty eating), hair loss (reversible), and need for IV nutrition and pain control.  
- Other risks include nausea (now well-controlled with modern antiemetics), rare liver toxicity (more common in heavily pretreated cancer patients), potential infertility (due to damage to egg/sperm precursors), and low but nonzero risks of late cancers or lung problems.  
- New, less toxic conditioning methods (e.g., antibodies targeting stem cells) are in development and may replace chemotherapy in the future, but they are not yet standard or fully validated for clinical use.

## 6. ADA-SCID (“bubble baby disease”) as a proof-of-concept for stem cell gene therapy

- **ADA-SCID** is a severe combined immunodeficiency where mutations in the ADA gene prevent immune cell development; affected infants lack functional T and B cells and typically die early from infections without treatment.  
- Historically, some children were kept in sterile isolation (“bubble babies”), as in the famous case of David Vetter, who lived 13 years in a sterile environment and ultimately died after a complicated transplant.  
- Dr. Kohn’s group has iteratively developed ADA-SCID gene therapy over decades, moving from early retroviral vectors to modern **lentiviral vectors** with improved safety and efficacy.  
- The current ADA-SCID vector uses a **codon-optimized ADA gene** driven by a human **EF1α (EFS) promoter**, which is strong enough to express the gene but designed not to inappropriately activate nearby genes.  
- Parallel trials at UCLA and Great Ormond Street Hospital (London) have treated over 60 ADA-SCID patients with this approach, providing a robust dataset on both efficacy and long-term safety.

## 7. Safety and long-term outcomes of lentiviral stem cell gene therapy across diseases

- In the ADA-SCID trials (50+ patients in the initial report, 62 in the latest), **100% of patients were alive** and 96% had “event-free survival” (no need for rescue transplant or return to enzyme replacement) at long-term follow-up.  
- Immune reconstitution (T-cell numbers and function) stabilized within ~6 months and remained stable out to 10–12 years, indicating that gene-modified HSCs persist and continue to produce functional immune cells.  
- No complications attributable to the lentiviral vector (e.g., leukemia from insertional mutagenesis) were observed in these ADA-SCID cohorts, supporting the safety of the EF1α-based design.  
- Across the field, at least **18 different genetic blood or metabolic diseases** have been treated with lentiviral HSC gene therapy, including neurodegenerative conditions like X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), and MPS I/III.  
- The main exception to the excellent safety record was an ALD trial using a vector with a **strong retroviral promoter (MND)**, where some patients developed pre-leukemic or leukemic changes due to activation of growth-related genes—this is the promoter type that raised concern for the original Angelman vector.

## 8. Rationale for applying hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy to Angelman syndrome

- Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to **monocytes**, which can migrate into tissues and differentiate into **macrophages** and microglia-like cells in the brain; a subset of these cells cross the blood–brain barrier.  
- During embryonic development, brain microglia arise from early progenitors, but after birth, bone marrow–derived monocytes can still enter the brain and become microglia-like cells, a process enhanced by bone marrow transplantation and busulfan conditioning.  
- For Angelman syndrome, the strategy is to engineer HSCs so that their brain-descendant cells (microglia-like cells) produce and **secrete UBE3A protein**, which can then be taken up by neighboring neurons (“cross-correction”).  
- This approach is analogous to successful HSC gene therapies for neuro-metabolic diseases, where donor-derived cells in the brain secrete missing enzymes that rescue surrounding neural tissue.  
- The central hypothesis is that if enough UBE3A-secreting microglia-like cells populate the brain, neuronal function and Angelman-related phenotypes can be substantially improved or normalized.

## 9. Redesigning the Angelman vector for safety and performance

- The original UC Davis Angelman mouse studies used a lentiviral vector carrying the **mouse Ube3a gene** driven by an **MND promoter**, a strong retroviral promoter known to be efficient but now associated with leukemia risk in ALD trials.  
- Because of this safety concern, the field has largely moved away from such promoters, especially for long-lived stem cells, and FAST sought to replace MND with promoters that have a strong **clinical safety track record**.  
- Dr. Kohn’s team designed new lentiviral vectors carrying **human UBE3A**, using safer promoters such as **EFS (EF1α short)** and **PGK**, both of which have been used in multiple clinical trials without evidence of insertional oncogenesis.  
- They also **codon-optimized** the UBE3A sequence to increase protein production without changing the protein itself, allowing these safer promoters to achieve expression levels comparable to or higher than the original MND-based vector.  
- The primary goal was to match or exceed the therapeutic efficacy seen in the Davis mouse model while significantly reducing the theoretical risk of vector-induced blood cancers.

## 10. Preclinical Angelman mouse data with the new vectors

- The UCLA team tested several groups of Angelman model mice: those receiving gene-corrected HSCs with EFS-UBE3A or PGK-UBE3A vectors, those receiving mock-transduced Angelman marrow, and those receiving wild-type (non-Angelman) marrow.  
- Engraftment was high in blood and bone marrow (around 80–90% donor cells, with ~1–2 vector copies per cell) and detectable in the brain at lower levels (reflecting the small fraction of brain cells that are microglia-like).  
- Behaviorally, treated Angelman mice (with either EFS or PGK vectors) showed **normalization of motor and cognitive performance** in tests such as open field (activity), rotarod (motor coordination), and novel object recognition (memory), matching wild-type controls.  
- EEG recordings showed that **delta power**, a hallmark abnormality in Angelman mice, was reduced to wild-type levels in treated animals, mirroring the full phenotypic rescue seen with the original Davis vector.  
- Immunohistochemistry confirmed UBE3A protein in brain neurons, consistent with secretion from microglia-like cells and uptake by neurons, supporting the cross-correction mechanism.

## 11. Translational plan: manufacturing, regulatory path, and trial design

- With funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and FAST, the team is moving from lab-grade to **GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice)**-grade vector production suitable for human use; the same manufacturer will later produce patient cell products.  
- Required **preclinical safety studies** include testing gene-modified human HSCs in immunodeficient mice to look for toxicity, abnormal proliferation, or tumor formation, along with extensive in vitro characterization.  
- A detailed **clinical protocol** and informed consent document are being drafted, after which the team will request a **pre-IND meeting** with the FDA to present data and plans and receive guidance on any additional studies needed.  
- Following completion of FDA-requested work, they will submit an **IND (Investigational New Drug) application** to open a first-in-human clinical trial of UBE3A HSC gene therapy for Angelman syndrome.  
- The aspirational timeline is to initiate a clinical trial within a few years, contingent on successful manufacturing, safety data, and regulatory review.

## 12. Open questions, limitations, and applicability across Angelman genotypes

- Practical feasibility: the procedure requires about a month of intensive medical care, including central IV lines, busulfan conditioning, and recovery from mucositis and cytopenias, which may be particularly challenging for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.  
- Safety uncertainties: while lentiviral HSC gene therapy has an excellent track record in other diseases, Angelman-specific factors (e.g., seizure burden, neurologic fragility) could introduce unique risks that must be carefully monitored.  
- Efficacy in humans is unknown: robust mouse data are encouraging, but it remains to be seen how much clinical improvement can be achieved in people, at what ages, and for which symptom domains.  
- **Genotype considerations:**  
  - Any **loss-of-function** genotype (deletion, UBE3A mutation, UPD, imprinting center defect, mosaic) that lacks functional UBE3A should, in principle, be addressable by UBE3A replacement, making this approach largely **genotype-agnostic**.  
  - For large deletions, other missing genes may contribute to phenotype; UBE3A replacement is expected to be the first and major step, with other genes potentially addressed later by additional modalities (e.g., ASOs, CRISPR, or multi-gene constructs if technology allows).  
- Future refinements may include combining UBE3A HSC gene therapy with other therapies (e.g., AAV, ASOs, editing) to address residual deficits or additional genes, but for the next decade, this platform is focused on **UBE3A replacement** as the core therapeutic goal.
