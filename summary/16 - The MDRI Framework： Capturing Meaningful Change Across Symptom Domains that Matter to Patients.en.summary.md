**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk explains the MDRI (Multi‑Domain Responder Index), a statistical and clinical framework designed to capture meaningful change across multiple symptom domains in Angelman syndrome clinical trials. Dr. Kim Goodspeed shows how MDRI can better reflect real-world, patient‑relevant benefits than traditional single‑endpoint trial designs, using the GTX‑102 open‑label study as an example. The focus is on the methodology—how MDRI is built, how it works, and why it matters for rare disease trials.

### 1. Why a new framework like MDRI is needed in rare disease trials

- Traditional clinical trials usually rely on **one primary efficacy endpoint**—a single symptom measured in a single way—which is difficult in rare, complex disorders like Angelman syndrome.  
- To show benefit on that one endpoint, most participants must have that symptom at baseline, which can **narrow the study population** and limit how generalizable the results are to the broader community.  
- New therapies (ASOs, gene therapy, CRISPR, etc.) target the **underlying cause** of Angelman syndrome, so improvements may appear across **many different symptoms**, not just one.  
- Patients start with different symptom profiles, so a “one‑size‑fits‑all” endpoint can **miss important benefits** that matter to families but aren’t captured by the chosen primary measure.  
- MDRI is proposed as a solution: a way to **systematically evaluate multiple symptom domains at once**, aligning trial outcomes more closely with real‑world, patient‑relevant change.

### 2. What the MDRI (Multi‑Domain Responder Index) is—and what it is not

- MDRI is an **analytical strategy**, not a drug or a scale by itself: it is a framework for combining information from several **clinically distinct, important symptom domains** into a single responder index.  
- Each domain (e.g., sleep, motor, behavior) is measured with its **own appropriate endpoint**, and each endpoint has a defined threshold for what counts as a meaningful improvement or worsening.  
- MDRI then assigns a simple score (+1, 0, −1) per domain and **tallies these across domains** to describe each participant’s overall response.  
- MDRI is **not a composite endpoint**: composite endpoints usually measure **one symptom** in multiple ways (e.g., several measures of coronary artery disease severity), whereas MDRI combines **different symptoms** that are each independently meaningful.  
- This distinction matters because MDRI is explicitly designed to reflect the **multi‑faceted nature** of Angelman syndrome rather than over‑measuring a single aspect.

### 3. Step‑by‑step: How the MDRI works

- First, researchers **select 4–6 clinically meaningful domains**; in the GTX‑102 Angelman trial they chose **five**, which they considered a “sweet spot” between breadth and practicality.  
- For each domain, they **choose a clinical endpoint** (a specific scale or measure) that best captures that symptom and can be measured reliably and independently.  
- They then define a **Meaningful Score Difference (MSD)** for each endpoint: the smallest change that is considered clinically meaningful improvement or worsening.  
- Each participant’s change in each domain is scored:  
  - **+1 (green):** change meets or exceeds the MSD in the direction of improvement  
  - **−1 (pink):** change meets or exceeds the MSD in the direction of worsening  
  - **0 (white):** change does not reach the threshold in either direction (uncertain clinical meaning)  
- The scores across domains are **summed per participant** to yield a net MDRI score, which can then be analyzed statistically across the group to determine overall responder rates and significance.

### 4. Choosing the Angelman‑specific domains and endpoints

- The five domains were chosen based on **disease concept and natural history studies**—i.e., what families and clinicians identified as the most important and unmet needs in Angelman syndrome.  
- The selected domains were: **sleep, motor, behavior, communication, and cognition**, reflecting the broad, complex phenotype of Angelman syndrome.  
- For each domain, the team reviewed multiple candidate measures from their Phase 1/2 data and **asked families which measures best captured what they cared about**, then selected the most appropriate endpoint.  
- For example, **sleep** was measured using the **sleep domain of the Angelman Syndrome Severity Assessment (ASSA)**, a clinician‑completed scale; similar logic was applied to the other domains.  
- This process ensures that MDRI is **grounded in patient and caregiver priorities**, not just in what is convenient to measure.

### 5. Defining “meaningful change” (Meaningful Score Difference / MSD)

- The **Meaningful Score Difference (MSD)** is the threshold of change on each endpoint that is considered **clinically meaningful**—large enough that families and clinicians would view it as a real improvement or worsening.  
- This concept has been called by various names (e.g., MID – Minimal Important Difference), but the core idea is the same: define a **numerical cutoff** that separates “noise” from meaningful change.  
- In this MDRI, each domain has its own MSD; for example, some domains use **±1 point**, others **±6 points**, and another **±5 points**, depending on the scale and what is considered meaningful.  
- Changes that meet or exceed the MSD in the positive direction get **+1**, and those that meet or exceed it in the negative direction get **−1**; anything smaller is scored **0** because it may not reflect a true treatment effect.  
- By pre‑defining these thresholds, MDRI ensures that the analysis focuses on **changes that matter clinically**, not just statistically small shifts.

### 6. Interpreting MDRI scores at the individual and group level

- In MDRI visualizations, **each column** is a domain, **each row** is a participant, and **each box** is color‑coded by that domain’s score (green +1, white 0, pink −1).  
- Example 1: A participant with green boxes in all five domains has **+1 in each**, for a total MDRI score of **+5**, the maximum possible, indicating broad improvement across all measured areas.  
- Example 2: A participant with three green and two white boxes has **+3**, showing meaningful improvement in three domains and no clear change in two.  
- Example 3: A participant with two green, two pink, and one white box has **+2 −2 +0 = 0**, indicating improvements in some domains offset by worsening in others, for a net neutral MDRI score.  
- At the **group level**, researchers can calculate the distribution of MDRI scores, overall responder rates, and statistical significance, while still also analyzing each endpoint separately on a continuous scale for more detailed understanding.

### 7. Advantages and implications of MDRI for Angelman syndrome and similar disorders

- MDRI allows **enrollment of a broader, more representative population**, because participants do not all need to have the same dominant symptom at baseline to be counted as responders.  
- It captures **holistic, multi‑domain change**, aligning trial outcomes with the reality that Angelman syndrome is a **diverse, global disorder** affecting many aspects of function.  
- The framework supports better **interpretability and generalizability** of results, including safety data, because it reflects a more diverse clinical presentation.  
- MDRI is **complementary**, not a replacement, to traditional analyses: it adds a powerful way to visualize and quantify clinically meaningful improvements across domains while standard continuous analyses are still performed.  
- For complex phenotypes like Angelman syndrome, MDRI offers a **patient‑centered, methodologically rigorous tool** to evaluate whether new therapies are truly making a meaningful difference in the areas that matter most to families.
