**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
Dr. Bridget Keller presents Project WellCAST, a large NIH-funded clinical trial designed to personalize fully remote mental health support for caregivers of individuals with rare genetic conditions, including Angelman syndrome. The project developed and iteratively refined a “precision health” decision tool (algorithm) that matches caregivers to different evidence-based supports based on a rich picture of their lives, not just a single mental health score. Results show the model is feasible, acceptable, and effective, with strong caregiver engagement and improvements in depression.

### 1. Why caregiver mental health needs personalized support

- Traditional clinical encounters usually focus on two things: whether a caregiver’s mental health scores cross a clinical threshold (e.g., on a depression or anxiety checklist) and what services are locally available. For rare disease caregivers, especially Angelman families, this is often inadequate because their situations differ dramatically from “typical” clinic populations. Dr. Keller emphasizes that caregivers vary in feelings about the diagnosis, the child’s specific needs, existing care and treatments, cultural values, social support, caregiving stage (new vs decades in), personality, time constraints, literacy, and access to respite care. These many factors together form the “topography of your life,” meaning the overall pattern and context of daily living, stressors, and resources. The central idea is that effective support must be matched not just to symptom scores but to this broader life context.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Caregiver mental health support should be individualized, not “one-size-fits-all,” especially in rare conditions like Angelman syndrome.  
- Clinicians and systems need to consider a wide range of factors—caregiving stage, cultural background, support network, time and respite, and personal values—when recommending interventions.  
- Families can advocate for themselves by explicitly sharing these contextual factors with providers, not just answering symptom checklists.  
- “Personalization” here means aligning the type and intensity of support with the caregiver’s real-world constraints and preferences.  
- This broader view aims to increase both the relevance and the effectiveness of mental health support for caregivers.

### 2. Concept and goals of Project WellCAST

- Project WellCAST grew out of pilot data funded by the Angelman Syndrome Foundation in 2019, meaning Angelman caregivers were central from the beginning. The team then secured about $3 million from the NIH to build a “precision health tool” (a structured decision process, not AI) to match caregivers to appropriate supports. The main goal was to see how to connect caregivers of people with rare genetic conditions to 100% remote support that fits their unique family needs. The tool is intended to be usable by clinicians, policy leaders, and patient advocacy groups (PAGs) to guide what to offer families. The trial was explicitly designed to test, learn from, and improve this tool over time, acknowledging from the outset that the first version would not be perfect.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Project WellCAST aims to create a practical, evidence-based decision tool that helps match caregivers to the right kind of support.  
- All support in the trial was fully remote, making it accessible regardless of geography.  
- The project is meant to inform not just individual clinicians but also systems and advocacy groups about how to structure caregiver support.  
- Angelman caregivers were part of the foundational work, ensuring relevance to this community.  
- The team committed to iterative improvement, building learning and refinement into the trial design.

### 3. Designing the precision health algorithm and data collection methods

- The “algorithm” here is a clinical decision tree: a structured set of if–then rules that suggest which treatment or support program might fit a given caregiver profile. To build it, the team collected two weeks of data from each participating family at study entry. First, caregivers completed standard self-report questionnaires (e.g., mental health scales) that many are already familiar with. Second, they used **ecological momentary assessment (EMA)**: brief surveys sent to caregivers’ smartphones throughout their daily lives, asking about stress, mood, context, and other real-time factors. Combining these data, they mapped caregiver profiles to existing evidence-based treatments available in communities, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and peer-to-peer coaching.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- The decision tool is based on both traditional questionnaires and real-time smartphone-based data, giving a richer picture of caregiver life.  
- Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) captures how caregivers feel and function in the moment, rather than relying only on retrospective recall.  
- The algorithm links specific caregiver profiles to known interventions like ACT and peer coaching, aiming for “best fit” rather than a generic offer.  
- This approach can help move beyond simple symptom thresholds to more nuanced treatment matching.  
- Caregivers’ everyday experiences, not just clinic-day responses, directly inform which supports are recommended.

### 4. Community–academic partnership and trial design

- The project was built as a **community–academic partnership**, meaning researchers worked closely with caregivers and community stakeholders. They hired eight rare disorder caregiver coaches who were themselves caregivers and integrated them into the research team. These peer coaches helped deliver some of the treatments, advised on how to improve the algorithm, and mentored over 50 clinical trainees (graduate students) across the U.S. and New Zealand. The trainees provided therapy and support programs under supervision, turning the project into a training ground for the next generation of clinicians. In the trial, participants were randomly assigned either to receive treatment selected by the algorithm or to receive a more randomly assigned treatment, allowing the team to compare outcomes.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Peer caregivers were not just participants; they were hired as coaches and co-creators, shaping how support was delivered.  
- Graduate student clinicians gained specialized experience in rare disease caregiver support, expanding future workforce capacity.  
- The trial’s design allowed a direct test of whether algorithm-guided matching improves outcomes compared to more random assignment.  
- Community input was central to refining both the decision tool and the way services were offered.  
- This model shows how research, training, and real-world support can be integrated in a single project.

### 5. Cascade paneling: refining the algorithm during the trial

- The team developed a new protocol called **cascade paneling** to guide how they would adjust the algorithm as data came in. Cascade paneling involves predefining criteria for when and how to change the decision rules, then reviewing data with community partners to make those changes in a structured way. Over four semesters, they implemented three different versions of the algorithm, each refined based on trial data and caregiver feedback. This allowed them to learn quickly what worked and what didn’t, rather than waiting until the end of the study. The method has been published so others can use it to make clinically informed, data-driven adjustments in similar research settings.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Cascade paneling is a systematic way to refine a clinical decision tool while a trial is still running.  
- Changes to the algorithm were not ad hoc; they followed pre-set rules and were informed by both data and caregiver input.  
- Multiple algorithm versions were tested in rapid succession, accelerating learning about what best supports caregivers.  
- This approach acknowledges that initial models will be imperfect and builds improvement into the research design.  
- The published method can guide other teams who want to co-evolve interventions with real-world data and community feedback.

### 6. Trial scale, participants, and interventions delivered

- The study enrolled over 400 families, including 64 Angelman caregivers, across the United States. Across the protocol, families received substantial support: more than 1,400 coaching sessions were delivered. In addition, participants received over 2,400 hours of free therapy and support programs from graduate student trainees. The team also collected a large volume of data: over 80,000 smartphone EMA surveys across four semesters, plus standard self-report forms and some additional behavioral measures. Part of the project (not detailed in the talk) examined whether peer coaching could boost engagement in clinical trials, a topic of particular interest for industry partners.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- The trial was large for a rare disease–focused caregiver study and included a meaningful number of Angelman families.  
- Caregivers received not just assessments but substantial, no-cost support in the form of coaching and therapy.  
- The volume of EMA data provides a rich resource for understanding day-to-day caregiver experiences.  
- Peer coaching is being explored as a strategy to improve caregiver engagement in research and treatment programs.  
- The scale and structure of the trial make its findings relevant for both clinical practice and industry-sponsored studies.

### 7. Key outcomes: feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy

- The team evaluated whether the model was **feasible**, **acceptable**, and **efficacious** (effective). Feasibility was strong: they repeatedly met their predefined 80% metric for things like participation and completion, showing that fully remote assessment and treatment can work for these families. Acceptability was also high; because no existing measure fit their needs, they developed a new tool that assessed both the program and its context from the caregiver perspective. Using this tool, 91% of participants—regardless of whether they received their first-choice treatment—rated the program as acceptable. Early efficacy data show improvements in depression across treatments, and EMA-based outcomes are revealing additional, more nuanced changes that will be reported in future publications.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Fully remote, personalized caregiver support is practical and sustainable, with high participation rates.  
- Most caregivers found the program acceptable and worthwhile, even when they did not get their preferred treatment type.  
- The new acceptability measure may be useful for other teams evaluating caregiver-focused programs.  
- Depression symptoms improved, indicating that the supports provided had real mental health benefits.  
- EMA outcomes suggest that looking at real-time data can uncover changes that standard questionnaires might miss.
