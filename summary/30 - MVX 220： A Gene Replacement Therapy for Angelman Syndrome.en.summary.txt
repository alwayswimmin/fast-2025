## 1. Parent-driven origin and long-term collaboration leading to MVX220

- The program began with a 2016 email from a parent-scientist (a veterinarian, clinical researcher, and now FAST Chief Science Officer) to Dr. Jim Wilson, asking him to help develop a gene therapy for Angelman syndrome.  
- That email outlined Angelman syndrome as a monogenic neurogenetic disorder caused by loss of function of the maternal **UBE3A** gene on chromosome 15, with a normal paternal copy that is silenced in neurons.  
- The parent emphasized both urgency and rigor, describing her own clinical trial experience, the non-degenerative nature of Angelman brains, and existing mouse data showing gene therapy could work in adult models.  
- Dr. Wilson replied the same day and maintained continuous engagement, with over 1,600 emails exchanged since 2016, illustrating sustained collaboration between scientists and the Angelman community.  
- This story underscores that the Angelman gene therapy program was initiated and driven by parents and FAST, who actively recruited top scientists and kept the effort moving forward.

## 2. Gene therapy platform concept and why a “platform” matters

- A **platform** in gene therapy means using the same core components—vector capsid, delivery route, dose range, and manufacturing process—while swapping only the therapeutic gene to treat different diseases.  
- For CNS diseases, the platform targets **neurons**, not liver or other organs, and uses a consistent AAV capsid, intracerebrospinal delivery route, and standardized manufacturing.  
- Advantages of a platform include: higher probability of success and safety once one program works, faster and simpler regulatory paths, and more efficient use of capital and resources.  
- The Angelman program (MVX220) is built on this CNS platform, so it benefits from prior safety and efficacy data in other pediatric neurodegenerative diseases.  
- This approach allows lessons learned in one disease (e.g., dosing, immune management, procedural safety) to be directly applied to Angelman syndrome.

## 3. IV AAV delivery vs. CSF (ICM) delivery and rationale for route selection

- Traditional AAV gene therapies for muscle and brain often use **intravenous (IV)** delivery, but imaging in monkeys shows that IV AAV primarily goes to the **liver**, not the brain, because liver capillaries are porous while the **blood–brain barrier** blocks large particles.  
- To get enough vector into the brain via IV, doses must be very high (around **10¹⁴ vector genomes/kg**), which is near or above the threshold where serious, sometimes lethal, toxicities have been observed.  
- In contrast, delivering AAV directly into the **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)**—specifically via the **cisterna magna** (ICM)—greatly increases brain exposure and reduces liver exposure, allowing much lower total doses.  
- Experiments comparing ICM vs. lumbar CSF injection in monkeys showed that lumbar delivery (common for ASOs) does not efficiently deliver AAV to the brain, though it may be adequate for spinal cord–focused diseases.  
- For Angelman, the team chose **ICM delivery** to maximize brain targeting, widen the safety margin (lower systemic exposure and dose), and reduce manufacturing burden and cost.

## 4. CNS AAV platform development, safety experience, and related clinical programs

- Over 10–15 years, Dr. Wilson’s group developed a CNS AAV platform using a consistent capsid, ICM delivery, and a fermentation-based manufacturing process, and tested it extensively in **571+ non-human primates**.  
- This platform has been applied to several severe pediatric CNS diseases with bystander effects (where correcting some cells can help the whole system), such as **Hunter syndrome (MPS II)**, **Hurler syndrome (MPS I)**, **GM1 gangliosidosis**, **Krabbe disease**, and **metachromatic leukodystrophy**.  
- Companies like **Regenxbio** and **Gemma Bio** (and its subsidiary **Rare**) have taken these programs into clinical trials; the Hunter syndrome product is expected to receive regulatory approval, validating the platform.  
- The accumulated data provide strong procedural safety experience (ICM technique, anesthesia, monitoring) and product safety (vector behavior, immune responses, durability of expression) across ages from 6 months to 80 years.  
- This background gave the team confidence to move into a non-lethal, developmental condition like Angelman syndrome, where risk tolerance is lower and long-term safety is critical.

## 5. Overview of MVX220: what it is and how it works

- **MVX220** is an investigational **gene replacement therapy** for Angelman syndrome using an **AAVhu68** vector (a specific AAV capsid variant optimized for CNS delivery).  
- The vector carries a **codon-optimized human UBE3A gene** under the control of a **human synapsin promoter**, which ensures expression specifically in neurons (the cells where UBE3A is normally imprinted and missing).  
- The AAV vector is modified so it no longer replicates; it acts as a delivery vehicle: it enters neurons, the capsid degrades, and the UBE3A gene remains as an episome, producing UBE3A protein long-term.  
- MVX220 is delivered **intracisterna magna (ICM)** into the CSF under CT guidance and general anesthesia, placing the vector close to the brain to maximize neuronal transduction.  
- The dose is **based on estimated brain weight from MRI**, not just body weight, and is significantly lower than doses required for IV delivery, aiming to reduce systemic toxicity while achieving effective brain exposure.

## 6. Trial design: ASCEND-AS phase 1/2 study structure and objectives

- The trial, called **MVX AAV1** or **ASCEND Angelman Syndrome (ASCEND-AS)**, is a **first-in-human, phase 1/2, open-label** study of MVX220 in individuals with Angelman syndrome.  
- It includes **adult and pediatric cohorts**, with dosing via ICM; there is **no placebo group**, because the procedure is invasive and all participants receive active treatment.  
- The **primary objective** is to evaluate **safety and tolerability** of MVX220 in Angelman patients, as is standard for first-in-human gene therapy trials.  
- **Key secondary objectives** include measuring MVX220 levels in blood and CSF (pharmacokinetics/biomarkers) and assessing **efficacy** using a battery of clinical outcome measures developed and refined in prior ASO and natural history studies.  
- Dosing is **sequential** with built-in safety pauses: each participant is treated, followed for several months, and reviewed by an independent safety committee before the next participant is dosed.

## 7. Outcome measures and what the trial will assess

- The trial uses outcome measures aligned with domains identified as important by families and the FDA in the **Patient-Focused Drug Development (PFDD)** meeting for Angelman syndrome.  
- **Communication** is assessed with the **ORCA** (a caregiver-reported measure tailored to individuals with significant communication impairments), plus standardized tools like the **Vineland** and **Bayley** scales and a clinician global impression (ASA/CGI).  
- **Cognition, daily living skills, gross and fine motor function, behavior, and sleep** are measured using combinations of the Bayley, Vineland, clinician global impressions, sleep diaries, and a gait analysis device.  
- **Quality of life** is evaluated with a disability/quality-of-life scale that captures both patient and caregiver impact after gene therapy.  
- Multiple **biomarkers** are included: EEG, MRI, and measurements of vector and UBE3A-related markers in blood and CSF, to link biological changes with clinical outcomes.

## 8. Eligibility criteria and key exclusions

- **Inclusion criteria** (for current cohorts) include:  
  - Age **18–50 years** for the initial adult cohort; later pediatric cohort planned for **4–8 years** (the slides also mention 2–8 years as the eventual pediatric range).  
  - Genetic subtypes: **UPD (uniparental disomy)** or **ICD (imprinting center defect)**; **mutation** cases are excluded due to higher variability in phenotype in a small trial.  
  - Ability to **ambulate independently**, to allow assessment of sensory nerve function and gait after treatment.  
  - Stable anti-seizure medications and stable specialized diets (e.g., ketogenic, LGIT) before enrollment.  
- **Exclusion criteria** include: significant other medical conditions or lab abnormalities, recent serious infections, recent immunizations (which activate the immune system), autoimmune diseases, recent ASO treatment (must be >1 year ago), inability to undergo MRI or dosing safely, and contraindications to steroid use.

## 9. Study procedures, monitoring, and risk management

- Participants undergo a detailed **screening phase** with clinical exams, labs, imaging, and functional assessments to confirm eligibility and establish baselines.  
- On **dosing day**, under general anesthesia, a trained interventional neuroradiologist performs **ICM injection** under continuous CT guidance, with the head positioned to access the cisterna magna while protecting vital structures.  
- After dosing, participants are **admitted to the hospital** (days 1–3) and undergo **intensive monitoring**: daily labs for at least 7 days, frequent physical exams, and specific checks for liver size, organ function, and neurological status to detect early immune or toxicity signals.  
- **Steroids** are administered to dampen the immune response against the AAV vector, reducing the risk that the immune system will destroy transduced cells or cause systemic inflammation; steroid side effects (e.g., infection risk, reflux, sleep changes, appetite increase) are monitored and managed.  
- Longer-term follow-up includes scheduled visits to monitor safety (organ function, sensory nerves/dorsal root ganglia, immune markers) and to track emerging developmental changes, recognizing that the time course and magnitude of benefit in humans are still unknown.

## 10. First patient dosing, current sites, and next steps

- The **first patient** in the ASCEND-AS trial has been successfully treated via ICM at **Rush University Medical Center**, with imaging confirming accurate needle placement in the cisterna magna and no immediate procedural complications.  
- The procedure at Rush was the first of its kind there; the team was trained at UPenn, and Dr. Brian Pukenas (a key interventional radiologist in the platform) was present to supervise and ensure correct technique.  
- As of the talk, there are **two active sites**: Rush and the University of Pennsylvania; UPenn is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov and preparing to recruit.  
- A **Clinical Trial Application** has been approved by **Health Canada**, enabling potential recruitment of pediatric patients in Canada for the pediatric cohort.  
- The trial will proceed with sequential dosing, safety reviews, and eventual expansion to pediatric participants, with ongoing public updates via ClinicalTrials.gov and community channels.

## 11. Acknowledgments and the role of the Angelman community and FAST

- MVX220 was **funded entirely by FAST** from proof-of-concept through IND-enabling studies, in close collaboration with Dr. Wilson’s team at Penn and later Gemma Bio.  
- FAST and ABOM worked together to develop the **regulatory framework and clinically meaningful endpoints** that the FDA would accept, building on natural history and prior ASO trial experience.  
- The Rush team (regulatory staff, coordinators, pharmacy, anesthesia, neuroradiology, PICU, contracts, and administration) collaborated intensively to open the trial quickly and safely and to complete the first dosing before this meeting.  
- The speakers emphasize the courage of the **first patient and family**, who act as pioneers for the entire Angelman community by accepting the unknowns of first-in-human gene therapy.  
- The talk closes by recognizing that this achievement required a “village” of scientists, clinicians, regulators, funders, and families, and that the community’s sustained support and pressure were essential to bringing Angelman gene therapy into the clinic.
