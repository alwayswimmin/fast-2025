### 1. Introduction to Oak Hill Bio and its mission

- **Oak Hill Bio** is a biotechnology company focused on “rescuing and advancing” promising drug candidates that have been deprioritized by larger companies for internal or strategic reasons, not because of safety or efficacy problems.  
- Rugonersen is a prime example: it was deprioritized at Roche, and Oak Hill Bio acquired it specifically to continue its development and move it into Phase 3 for Angelman syndrome.  
- The company has done something similar in neonatology with another molecule, showing a pattern of picking up high-potential assets in vulnerable populations.  
- The rugonersen team at Oak Hill Bio includes four former Roche team members, providing continuity of expertise and experience with the molecule and the Angelman community.  
- Oak Hill Bio emphasizes **transparent communication** with the Angelman syndrome community and aims to share updates as they move toward enrolling the first patient in the BEACON trial.

### 2. History of the Angelman syndrome program and prior studies

- Since around **2015**, the team has worked closely with the Angelman community to understand the disease and what matters most to families and clinicians.  
- A **disease concept model** was developed (with Ovid/“a bomb” in the transcript) to map out key symptoms, impacts, and priorities for treatment in Angelman syndrome; this guides what outcomes to measure in trials.  
- An **observational study** called **FRIAS** (with Biogen/Ionis) was completed to better understand the natural history and variability of Angelman syndrome over time.  
- The **Tangelo Phase 1 trial** of rugonersen in children with Angelman syndrome has been completed, and its results were published in *Nature Medicine*; a PET study at Rush examined how rugonersen distributes in the brain after intrathecal (lumbar puncture) administration.  
- The program has now progressed from understanding the disease and natural history, to early clinical testing, and is poised to start the **BEACON Phase 3** trial.

### 3. Mechanism of action of rugonersen

- **Rugonersen** is an **antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)**—a short, synthetic strand of nucleic acid designed to bind to a specific RNA target in cells.  
- In Angelman syndrome, the maternal copy of the **UBE3A** gene is missing or nonfunctional, and the paternal copy is normally silenced in neurons by a long **antisense RNA** (a “block” that prevents expression).  
- Rugonersen is designed to bind to this **UBE3A antisense transcript**, reducing or removing the antisense “block” so that the paternal UBE3A allele can be expressed.  
- When the antisense is reduced, the **UBE3A mRNA** (the message that encodes the UBE3A protein) increases, and this leads to increased production of **UBE3A protein** in neurons, which is missing or severely reduced in Angelman syndrome.  
- The goal is that restoring UBE3A protein in the brain will improve brain function and development, potentially addressing core features of Angelman syndrome.

### 4. Drug development pathway and why rugonersen advanced

- Drug development typically moves through **discovery → preclinical → clinical (Phase 1, 2, 3) → approval**, and many molecules fail along the way.  
- Rugonersen started as one of **over 2,000 antisense oligonucleotides** screened at Roche; it was selected and advanced into preclinical testing because it showed strong activity against the UBE3A antisense target.  
- In **preclinical studies** (including in non-human primates/monkeys), rugonersen was given intrathecally (into the cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar puncture) and showed:  
  - A **dose-dependent reduction** in the antisense RNA (the “block”),  
  - An **increase in UBE3A mRNA**, and  
  - A **sustained increase in UBE3A protein** for at least 85 days.  
- A **PET imaging study** in healthy adults at Rush, using microdoses of rugonersen, confirmed that after intrathecal administration, the drug **reaches the brain** and distributes as expected.  
- Combined with early clinical data from Tangelo, these findings support that rugonersen is **potent**, can be dosed relatively high, and has a strong potential to translate into clinical benefit.

### 5. Key findings from the Tangelo Phase 1 trial

- **Tangelo** was an **open-label Phase 1/2 study** (everyone received active drug) in **61 children aged 1–12** with Angelman syndrome (deletion or mutation genotypes).  
- The trial had a **multiple ascending dose (MAD)** phase: starting with low doses in older children (5–12 years), then gradually increasing doses after safety review by an independent monitoring committee, followed by a **long-term extension** to observe ongoing safety and exploratory efficacy.  
- The **primary goals** were to assess **safety and tolerability**, understand **pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics** (how the drug behaves in the body), and explore **efficacy** using EEG and developmental scales.  
- Compared with natural history expectations, children treated with rugonersen showed **improvements in cognition and expressive communication** (measured with tools like the Bayley Scales), and a **dose-dependent reduction in abnormal EEG delta-band activity**, which is a known biomarker abnormality in Angelman syndrome.  
- Overall, rugonersen was **safe and adequately tolerated**, and the trial—now published in *Nature Medicine*—is the **first published antisense oligonucleotide trial in Angelman syndrome**, suggesting potential benefits in brain activity and development.

### 6. Expanded Access / Early Access program for current Tangelo participants

- With the transition from Roche to Oak Hill Bio, there was a key question: what happens to families already in Tangelo who wish to continue treatment?  
- Oak Hill Bio has initiated an **Expanded Access / Early Access Program** for participants who:  
  - Were enrolled in Tangelo,  
  - Signed informed consent for the optional open-label extension, and  
  - Wish to continue receiving rugonersen.  
- This program is available in both **Europe and the United States**, allowing eligible participants to continue treatment outside of a formal efficacy trial while BEACON is being launched.  
- Families interested in this program can contact Oak Hill Bio via the provided email address (mentioned in the talk) to obtain more information and coordinate with their study site.  
- Expanded access is intended to bridge the gap between early trials and later-phase studies, ensuring continuity of care for participants who may be benefiting from the investigational therapy.

### 7. Design and goals of the BEACON Phase 3 trial

- **BEACON** is a **Phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled** clinical trial of intrathecal rugonersen in **pediatric and adult participants** with Angelman syndrome.  
- The plan is to enroll about **150 participants aged 1–50 years**, both males and females, with either **deletion or mutation** genotypes, across multiple countries; the trial is expected to start in the **US in Q1 of next year**.  
- Study design:  
  - **Screening period**, then  
  - **Randomization 1:1** to rugonersen vs placebo for about **12 months** (double-blind), followed by  
  - A **2-year open-label extension** where **all participants receive rugonersen**.  
- Outcome measures will include developmental and functional scales such as **Bayley-4**, **USCIS (User Case)**, **EEG**, **Clinical Global Impression (CGI)**, caregiver questionnaires (e.g., **Vineland**, **ORCA**, and others), to capture cognition, communication, behavior, and daily functioning.  
- Oak Hill Bio plans to support families with **travel, meals, hotel stays near study sites, and comfort items** during visits, though the exact support may vary by country and site regulations.

### 8. Eligibility: who can and cannot participate in BEACON

- **Who can participate (key inclusion points):**  
  - **Age 1–50 years**, male or female.  
  - **Clinical and genetic diagnosis** of Angelman syndrome (deletion or mutation genotypes).  
  - **Stable medical condition** and **stable medications** for at least **4 weeks** before screening.  
  - **Minimum body weight** of about **7 kg** (to ensure safe dosing and procedures).  
- **Who cannot participate (key exclusion points):**  
  - Individuals with **UPD (uniparental disomy)** or **ICD (imprinting center defect)** genotypes are not included in this trial.  
  - Those with **serious heart, liver, kidney, or other significant diseases**, or **ongoing infections**, or any condition that would pose an increased risk for **lumbar puncture** (intrathecal administration).  
  - Individuals with **prior or ongoing participation** in other **ASO, gene therapy, or cell therapy trials** for Angelman syndrome.  
  - Additional detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria will be provided by each study site and in the trial protocol.

### 9. Role of caregivers and social media considerations

- **Caregivers** are essential to the success of the BEACON trial: they must attend visits, provide updates on the participant’s condition, and complete multiple questionnaires and rating scales.  
- Their observations help capture changes in communication, behavior, daily living skills, and overall functioning that may not be fully reflected in clinician assessments alone.  
- Caregivers are specifically asked **not to post any study details or impressions on social media** (e.g., whether they think their child is on drug or placebo, perceived changes, visit experiences).  
- Public sharing of such information can **bias perceptions**, influence other participants’ or investigators’ expectations, and potentially **compromise the scientific integrity** of the trial’s results.  
- Maintaining confidentiality about trial experiences helps ensure that the data collected are as objective and unbiased as possible, which is critical for regulatory evaluation and potential approval.
