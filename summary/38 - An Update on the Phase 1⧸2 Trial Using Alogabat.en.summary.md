## 1. Background on Angelman Syndrome Genetics and Clinical Differences

- Angelman syndrome is caused by lack of expression of the **UBE3A** gene from chromosome **15q**, but in **deletion Angelman syndrome**, a larger segment of chromosome 15q is missing, not just UBE3A. This deletion removes more than 10 additional genes, which contributes to a more severe clinical picture compared with patients who have a mutation in UBE3A but no large deletion. Natural history data show that individuals with deletion Angelman syndrome have more impaired cognition and overall clinical function than those with non-deletion (e.g., mutation) forms. In the talk, this is illustrated using **Bayley (Bayley Scales) cognitive data**, where deletion patients show more severe cognitive impairment. EEG studies also show that deletion Angelman patients have a **consistent decrease in beta band power**, in addition to the **increased delta band power** seen in all Angelman patients, highlighting a distinct neurophysiological profile.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences):**  
- Deletion Angelman syndrome involves loss of UBE3A plus many neighboring genes, making it biologically and clinically more severe than mutation-only cases.  
- Cognitive testing (e.g., Bayley scales) confirms that deletion patients are more severely affected.  
- EEG patterns differ: all Angelman patients show increased delta power, but deletion patients also show reduced beta power.  
- These differences suggest that therapies may need to be tailored to specific genetic subtypes (deletion vs. non-deletion).  
- Understanding these subtype differences is crucial for designing targeted treatments and interpreting trial results.

## 2. Role of GABA Genes and GABA-A α5 Receptors in Deletion Angelman Syndrome

- Among the genes deleted in many deletion Angelman patients are several **GABA-related genes**: **GABRB3, GABRA5, and GABRG3** (referred to as GABA B3, GABA A5, GABA A3 in the talk). The protein products of these genes assemble into a specific type of **GABA-A receptor** that includes the **α5 subunit (GABA-A α5 receptor)**. **GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)** is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; it reduces neuronal excitability and helps maintain balance between excitation and inhibition. Neurotransmitters like GABA only work when they bind to their specific receptors; if the receptor is reduced or dysfunctional (as in deletion of these GABA genes), the inhibitory signaling is impaired. It has been **postulated** that loss of these GABA genes contributes to the more severe clinical presentation and EEG abnormalities in deletion Angelman syndrome, and that **restoring GABA-A α5 function could be therapeutically beneficial**.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences):**  
- Deletion Angelman syndrome often removes key GABA receptor genes, leading to fewer functional **GABA-A α5 receptors**.  
- GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter; reduced GABA receptor function can cause brain network imbalance and may contribute to seizures, cognitive issues, and abnormal EEG patterns.  
- The specific EEG finding of reduced beta power in deletion patients may be linked to this GABA receptor deficit.  
- Targeting the GABA-A α5 receptor is a rational strategy to address a mechanism that is **unique and specific** to deletion Angelman syndrome.  
- This mechanistic link underpins the development of drugs like alogabat that modulate GABA-A α5 receptors.

## 3. Introduction to Alogabat: Mechanism, Prior Studies, and Rationale

- **Alogabat** (also pronounced “alugabet”) is described as a **GABA-A α5 positive allosteric modulator**. A **positive allosteric modulator (PAM)** is a compound that binds to a receptor at a site different from the main (orthosteric) binding site and **enhances the effect of the natural neurotransmitter** (in this case, GABA) without directly activating the receptor on its own. By binding to the GABA-A α5 receptor, alogabat is intended to **enhance the function** of the remaining receptors, potentially compensating for the loss of GABA receptor genes in deletion Angelman syndrome. Alogabat is an **oral, once-daily** investigational therapy. It has previously been studied in **healthy volunteers** and in a **Phase 2 trial in adults and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder**, where it showed an **acceptable safety and tolerability profile** to date.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences):**  
- Alogabat is designed to **boost the activity** of GABA-A α5 receptors rather than replace them.  
- As a positive allosteric modulator, it works only when GABA is present, potentially offering a more physiologic way to enhance inhibition.  
- Prior studies in healthy people and in autism suggest the drug can be given safely and is generally well tolerated.  
- The rationale in deletion Angelman syndrome is to compensate for the reduced number/function of GABA-A α5 receptors caused by gene deletions.  
- This makes alogabat a **mechanism-based therapy** specifically aligned with the biology of deletion Angelman syndrome.

## 4. Design and Objectives of the Alderbran Phase 1/2 Trial

- The **Alderbran** study is a **Phase 1/2, open-label** clinical trial in children and adolescents with **deletion Angelman syndrome**. **Open-label** means there is **no placebo group**; all participants receive alogabat. The primary goals are to evaluate **safety and tolerability** in this specific population and to characterize **pharmacokinetics (PK)**—what the body does to the drug (absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination) and what doses are appropriate. A key exploratory objective is to see whether alogabat’s enhancement of GABA-A α5 function leads to **changes in EEG**, especially **increasing beta band power**, which is reduced in deletion Angelman patients. The study also includes **exploratory clinical outcome measures** to look for potential functional or behavioral benefits, though these are not yet detailed in the talk.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences):**  
- The trial focuses on **children and adolescents (ages 5–17)** with deletion Angelman syndrome.  
- Main objectives: assess **safety**, **tolerability**, and **PK** of alogabat in this specific genetic subgroup.  
- EEG, particularly **beta band power**, is a key biomarker to test whether the drug is engaging its target and affecting brain function.  
- Clinical outcomes are being explored but are secondary to safety and biomarker readouts at this stage.  
- Because it is open-label, every participant receives the investigational drug, which can be attractive to families but limits placebo-controlled comparisons.

## 5. Enrollment Status, Community Contribution, and Expected Timelines

- The Alderbran study has enrolled **48 male and female participants** with deletion Angelman syndrome, aged **5–17 years**, across **20 sites in 6 countries**. The study is now **fully enrolled**, which is a significant milestone given the challenges. One major challenge was that many deletion Angelman patients use **benzodiazepines** for seizure control, and **benzodiazepine use was an exclusion criterion**, making it harder to find eligible participants. The speaker expresses strong appreciation for the Angelman community—families, patient organizations (including ASF, ASA, and others)—for their commitment and effort in enrolling and participating. The trial is expected to be **completed by Q2–Q3 next year**, with plans to share results as soon as they are available.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences):**  
- Enrollment is complete: 48 participants with deletion Angelman syndrome are in the study.  
- Benzodiazepine use for seizures excluded many potential participants, making recruitment particularly difficult.  
- Despite this, collaboration between families, clinicians, and patient organizations enabled full enrollment.  
- Study completion is anticipated in **mid to late next year (Q2–Q3)**.  
- Families and clinicians should watch for upcoming data releases once analysis is complete.

## 6. Concluding Remarks and Future Implications, Including Combination Therapies

- The Alderbran study is designed to **test the hypothesis** that restoring or enhancing GABA-A α5 receptor function can partially compensate for the loss of GABA genes in deletion Angelman syndrome. If successful, this could provide a **symptomatic or mechanism-based therapy** specifically beneficial for deletion patients. The speaker emphasizes that the study will help clarify the role of the deleted GABA genes and whether alogabat can offer therapeutic benefit. In the closing comments, the session moderator notes that this kind of drug might be **even more powerful in combination** with **gene replacement therapies or antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)** that restore both UBE3A and GABA genes, suggesting a future of **combination therapy** approaches. There is optimism that companies will consider such combinations to maximize benefit for individuals with Angelman syndrome.

**Key takeaways / actionable points (≤5 sentences):**  
- Alderbran will show whether pharmacologically boosting GABA-A α5 function can meaningfully help deletion Angelman patients.  
- Results will inform how important the deleted GABA genes are to the clinical and EEG phenotype.  
- Even if used alone, alogabat could become a targeted option for the deletion subtype.  
- In the future, combining GABA-targeted drugs with **gene therapies/ASOs** that restore UBE3A and GABA genes may yield greater benefits.  
- Stakeholders (families, clinicians, companies) should begin thinking about **rational combination strategies** as multiple therapeutic modalities emerge.
