## 2. Basics of Angelman Syndrome: Genetics and Biology

- Angelman syndrome is caused by a **severe reduction or absence of function of a single gene, UBE3A**, located on **chromosome 15**. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), one from each parent; for UBE3A, the **maternal copy is normally active in neurons**, while the **paternal copy is silenced**.  
- The paternal UBE3A is silenced in neurons by a **long non-coding RNA** called the **UBE3A antisense transcript (UBE3A-ATS)**, sometimes referred to as “the stop,” which prevents the paternal gene from being read.  
- In Angelman syndrome, the **maternal UBE3A is missing or not functional**, and because the paternal copy is silenced in neurons, there is effectively **no UBE3A protein in neurons**, while other tissues in the body still express UBE3A from the paternal allele.  
- UBE3A encodes an **E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme**, which tags proteins for degradation or stabilization, maintaining **protein homeostasis** at synapses (the junctions where neurons communicate).  
- Without proper UBE3A function, synaptic communication is disrupted—a **“synaptopathy”**—leading to impaired neuron-to-neuron and neuron-to-muscle signaling, which underlies the motor, cognitive, sleep, and communication symptoms of Angelman syndrome.

---

## 3. Genotypes, Deletions, and the Role of Neighboring Genes (e.g., GABA Genes)

- Angelman syndrome can arise through several genetic mechanisms:
  - **Maternal deletion** of a segment on chromosome 15 that includes UBE3A (most common).
  - **UBE3A mutation** (misspelling, small deletion/insertion within the gene).
  - **Uniparental disomy (UPD)** or **imprinting center defects (ICD)**, where both chromosome 15 copies behave like paternal copies (both silenced in neurons).
  - **Mosaicism**, where some cells have normal maternal UBE3A and others do not.  
- A **deletion** typically removes a **large segment** (e.g., ~6 million base pairs) including UBE3A and multiple neighboring genes, whereas a **mutation** might change just **one base pair** or a small region within UBE3A.  
- Because deletions remove additional genes, individuals with deletions may be **more symptomatic** than those with mutations, UPD, or ICD, who still have those neighboring genes intact.  
- Some of the key neighboring genes are **GABA receptor genes** (e.g., **GABRB3, GABRG3**), which are involved in inhibitory neurotransmission and may contribute to **seizures, sleep problems, motor issues, and learning difficulties** when one copy is missing.  
- These neighboring genes are **haploinsufficient** in deletions (only one working copy instead of two), so future therapies may need to **boost their expression** in addition to restoring UBE3A.

## 4. Clinical Impact on Individuals and Families

- Core features of Angelman syndrome include:
  - **Universal lack of functional speech** or very limited speech.
  - **Severe sleep disturbances**.
  - **Ataxia and incoordination**, with some individuals never achieving independent walking.
  - **Impulsivity, hyperactivity**, and sometimes **aggression or frustration**.
  - **Profound dependence** on caregivers for daily living and inability to live independently.  
- She emphasizes that Angelman syndrome is **not degenerative**—people can live a normal lifespan—but their **quality of life** is significantly impaired.  
- The disorder also has a **major impact on caregivers**, including inability to maintain employment, chronic sleep deprivation, anxiety, social isolation, and long-term fatigue.  
- She urges **drug developers** to consider not only the child’s symptoms but also the **burden on families** when defining what counts as a **“meaningful” treatment effect**.  
- Even partial improvements in domains like sleep, communication, or motor function can dramatically change both the individual’s and the family’s daily life.

## 5. Mosaicism and What It Teaches About Therapeutic Goals

- **Mosaic Angelman syndrome** occurs when the genetic error happens **after fertilization**, so some cells have normal maternal UBE3A and others do not.  
- Individuals with mosaicism may have only **1–5% of cells** expressing maternal UBE3A, yet many:
  - Have **some speech** (even sentences in some cases).
  - **Walk well**.
  - Often **do not have seizures**.  
- Some mosaic individuals with higher percentages of normal cells (e.g., ~40%) may be **mild enough to be misdiagnosed as neurotypical**, showing how powerful even partial restoration can be.  
- This teaches that **very small amounts of UBE3A (1–5%) can produce large quality-of-life gains**, and higher levels (e.g., 20–40%) may approach near-typical function.  
- This insight shapes drug development goals: even if a therapy cannot fully normalize UBE3A, **partial restoration could still be life-changing**.

## 6. The Five-Pillar Roadmap to a Cure

- FAST’s updated roadmap is organized into **five therapeutic pillars**:
  1. **Pillar 1 – Maternal UBE3A replacement:** Replace the missing UBE3A gene or protein (e.g., gene therapy, stem cell gene therapy, enzyme replacement).
  2. **Pillar 2 – Unsilencing the paternal allele:** “Stop the stop” by turning on the normally silent paternal UBE3A in neurons (e.g., ASOs, CRISPR, artificial transcription factors).
  3. **Pillar 3 – Adjacent genes:** Address genes outside UBE3A (especially in deletion, UPD, ICD genotypes) such as GABA genes that contribute to the clinical picture.
  4. **Pillar 4 – Downstream targets:** Modulate downstream pathways and synaptic function using small molecules and other approaches.
  5. **Pillar 5 – Clinical trial readiness:** Build the infrastructure—models, biomarkers, outcome measures, regulatory strategy, and advocacy—to run effective trials.  
- Each pillar represents a **different strategy** to improve brain function, and they are **complementary**, not mutually exclusive.  
- The roadmap is documented in the conference materials and is meant to guide both **research priorities** and **investment decisions**.  
- The overarching idea is to **pursue all plausible approaches (“all shots on goal”)** because no one yet knows which will work best in humans.  
- Pillar 5 underpins the others by ensuring that when therapies are ready, the field can **measure change and satisfy regulators**.

## 7. Pillar 1: Maternal Gene/Protein Replacement (Gene and Enzyme Therapies)

- **Goal:** Deliver functional UBE3A to neurons to replace the missing maternal gene/protein.  
- Main strategies:
  - **AAV gene therapy:** Use an adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a “delivery vehicle” where the harmful viral genes are removed and replaced with UBE3A; the virus is injected into the **cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)** (via lumbar puncture, cisterna magna, or ventricular injection), and potentially in the future via **intravenous delivery** if blood–brain barrier–crossing vectors prove safe and effective.
  - **Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy:** Modify a patient’s own blood stem cells outside the body to carry UBE3A, then re-infuse them so they engraft in bone marrow and produce cells that cross into the brain and secrete UBE3A to neurons.
  - **Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT):** Deliver the **UBE3A protein itself** into the brain, bypassing the need to alter DNA.  
- Preclinical mouse and non-human primate studies show that **AAV and HSC gene therapies can restore UBE3A expression and improve Angelman-like behaviors**, such as motor coordination and gait.  
- Safety is a major focus: for example, the HSC program replaced an older **MNDU3 promoter** (a DNA switch that drives gene expression) with promoters that have a **longer, safer clinical track record**, while still achieving strong UBE3A expression in neurons and robust behavioral rescue in mice.

---

## 8. Pillar 2: Unsilencing the Paternal UBE3A Allele

- **Goal:** Turn on the normally silent **paternal UBE3A** in neurons by interfering with the **UBE3A-ATS “stop” signal**.  
- Main technologies:
  - **Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs):** Short synthetic strands of nucleic acid that bind to UBE3A-ATS RNA and degrade or block it, allowing paternal UBE3A to be expressed.
  - **Zinc finger proteins / artificial transcription factors (ATFs):** Engineered DNA-binding proteins that can modify gene expression at specific sites.
  - **CRISPR-based gene editing or gene regulation:** Use CRISPR systems to cut, modify, or epigenetically silence the antisense transcript or otherwise activate paternal UBE3A.
  - **miRNA/siRNA/shRNA approaches:** Small RNA molecules that can target and reduce UBE3A-ATS or modulate related pathways.  
- In mouse models, **ASOs, zinc fingers, and CRISPR approaches** have successfully **restored UBE3A expression** in neurons and **improved Angelman-like behaviors**, including in **adolescent/adult mice**, not just newborns.  
- Video examples show untreated Angelman mice with poor coordination compared to treated mice that move more like wild-type, illustrating functional rescue.  
- These data support moving ASOs and other unsilencing strategies into **human clinical trials**, where early results (to be discussed in other talks) suggest **benefits across age groups**, challenging the idea that only very early treatment can help.

## 9. Pillar 3: Correcting Genes Adjacent to UBE3A in Deletion/UPD/ICD Genotypes

- **Goal:** Address the **additional gene losses** in individuals with **deletions, UPD, or imprinting center defects**, especially those genes that are haploinsufficient and clinically relevant (e.g., GABA genes).  
- FAST is supporting a program led by **UCSF**, in collaboration with **Yale University** and **North Carolina State University**, to **upregulate these haploinsufficient genes** using **CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)** or similar tools.  
- CRISPRa uses a **“dead” CRISPR enzyme** fused to activator domains to **turn up the expression** of a gene without cutting DNA, potentially increasing the output from the remaining paternal copy.  
- Early work has identified **constructs that can increase expression** of key human genes like **GABRB3 and GABRG3**, which are thought to contribute to seizures, sleep, and cognitive issues.  
- This pillar recognizes that **restoring UBE3A alone may not fully normalize function** in deletion/UPD/ICD genotypes and that **adjacent genes may need targeted correction** for maximal benefit.

---

## 10. Pillar 4: Targeting Downstream Pathways and Synaptic Function

- **Goal:** Improve neuronal and synaptic function by targeting **downstream pathways** affected by UBE3A loss, even without directly fixing the gene.  
- Multiple small-molecule and biologic programs are in development, including:
  - **Neuren** and **Helix**: small molecules aimed at synaptic function and plasticity.
  - **RO (Roche)**: developing **alobat** (a compound targeting specific synaptic or signaling pathways).
  - **Brown University**: working on **BDNF analogs** and **OPC (oligodendrocyte precursor cell) rescue** strategies to support brain connectivity and myelination.  
- These approaches aim to **modulate neurotransmission, plasticity, or network function** to improve cognition, behavior, sleep, and motor skills.  
- Because they often use **oral or systemic drugs**, they may be more accessible or acceptable to some families than invasive procedures.  
- Downstream therapies may be used **alone or in combination** with gene-targeted therapies to enhance overall benefit.

## 11. Pillar 5: Clinical Trial Readiness (Models, Measures, Policy, and Advocacy)

- **Goal:** Ensure that when therapies are ready, the field has the **tools, data, and regulatory alignment** to run successful clinical trials and get treatments approved.  
- Key components:
  - **Preclinical tools:** A wide array of **mouse, rat, and pig models**, plus **cell lines and organoids** representing all major genotypes, made available pre-competitively through repositories like **EBISC** and collaborations with **Yale**.
  - **INSYNC (International Angelman Syndrome Research Council):** A collaboration with the **Simons Foundation** and others to identify and fill scientific and translational gaps, and to share learnings across neurodevelopmental disorders.
  - **Policy and advocacy:** Activities like **Advocacy Day on Capitol Hill** to influence legislation, funding, and regulatory frameworks that support rare disease drug development.
  - **Externally Led Patient-Focused Drug Development (EL-PFDD) meeting:** A major effort where hundreds of families described which symptoms and changes are most meaningful, informing regulators and sponsors.  
- This pillar also includes building **regulatory strategy**, engaging with the **FDA**, and defining what constitutes **minimal clinically meaningful change** in Angelman syndrome.

---

## 12. Natural History, Outcome Measures, and the ABOM Consortium

- A long-running **natural history study** has followed **over 650 individuals** with Angelman syndrome for **~19.5 years** across multiple centers (e.g., Boston Children’s, Colorado, Canadian sites), documenting developmental trajectories.  
- Natural history data are crucial because early ASO trials (e.g., **Ionis** and **Ultragenyx**) were **open-label**, so the only comparison available was **treated patients vs. untreated natural history**.  
- In both Ionis and Ultragenyx data, treated individuals showed **improved trajectories in cognition and communication** compared to natural history, supporting the idea of a **treatment effect** and justifying progression to **phase 3 controlled trials**.  
- The **Angelman Syndrome Biomarker and Outcome Measure (ABOM) Consortium**, co-led by Allison and Jennifer Panagulius, has grown from a **$50,000 budget to over $5.1 million invested** since 2016, bringing together families, clinicians, industry, and the FDA.  
- ABOM’s mission is to:
  - Identify **domains that matter most** (communication, motor, sleep, daily living, etc.).
  - Develop and validate **outcome measures and biomarkers** that can detect meaningful change.
  - Ensure these tools are **accepted by regulators** and usable across trials.

## 13. Drug Development Realities, the “Valley of Death,” and Program Counts Over Time

- Traditional drug development is **slow, expensive, and risky**: out of **~15,000 early-stage candidates**, typically **one** is approved.  
- The path includes:
  - **3–10 years** of preclinical work.
  - **2–3 years** of formal safety/toxicology studies.
  - **3–5 years** for early-phase (phase 1/2) trials.
  - **2–5 years** for late-phase (phase 3) trials.  
- The **“valley of death”** is the costly gap between promising animal data and first-in-human trials, often costing **$15–25 million per program**, where many projects stall because companies cannot or will not fund them.  
- FAST and the Angelman community have increasingly **filled this gap with philanthropic dollars**, enabling multiple programs to reach IND-enabling studies and clinical trials.  
- Program counts over time:
  - ~10 years ago: **5 programs** in early development, **0** in clinical trials.
  - ~8 years ago (after a major philanthropic gift): **15 programs**, **2** in clinical trials.
  - ~4 years ago: **34 programs**, **3** in clinical trials.
  - 2022 market downturn: programs dropped from **34 to 24**, illustrating the fragility of funding.
  - Last year: **27 programs**.
  - **Now (2025): 30 programs**, with **6 in clinical trials**, **3 in IND-enabling studies**, and **16** directly supported by FAST/family dollars.

## 14. The AS2 Bio Accelerator and Current Clinical Milestones

- Recognizing that traditional pharma models often fail rare diseases, FAST created **AS2 Bio**, a **drug development accelerator** using **venture philanthropy** to push promising therapies through the valley of death.  
- AS2 Bio coordinates:
  - **CRISPR-based programs** (with NIH and Yale support).
  - **HSC gene therapy** (with UCLA’s Don Kohn and the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, CIRM).
  - Partnerships with companies like **Mavericks Bio**, **Courageous**, **Transformatics**, and others.  
- A major milestone: the **IND (Investigational New Drug) application** for a gene therapy program cleared in **April**, and as of **yesterday**, the **first patient has been dosed** in the first Angelman **gene therapy clinical trial** (run by Mavericks Bio).  
- FAST also helped initiate the ASO program that Ultragenyx is now advancing, and continues to collaborate with **Ionis, Ovid, Encoded, and others**, maintaining a broad, non-exclusive support strategy.  
- The accelerator model is meant to **disrupt the traditional pipeline**, ensuring that promising therapies are not abandoned due to funding or shifting corporate priorities.

## 15. Closing Perspective: Multiple Shots on Goal and Persistence

- Different therapeutic modalities will likely:
  - Reach **different brain regions**.
  - Achieve **different levels of UBE3A**.
  - Have **different risk/benefit profiles** and **different burdens** (e.g., one-time gene therapy vs. repeated lumbar punctures vs. oral pills).  
- Families will have **different preferences**: some may avoid invasive procedures, others may prefer a one-time treatment, and some may only be able to participate in **remote or low-burden trials**.  
- Combination therapy may ultimately be optimal (e.g., **ASO + gene therapy**, or **small molecule + gene therapy**), but this can only be explored if **multiple platforms are developed in parallel**.  
- FAST’s strategy is to **support all credible shots on goal**, because no one yet knows which approach—or combination—will produce the most meaningful, safe, and durable improvements for people with Angelman syndrome.  
- The talk ends with the reminder that **“it always seems impossible until it’s done”**, underscoring the community’s determination to keep pushing until effective treatments—and ultimately a cure—are a reality.
