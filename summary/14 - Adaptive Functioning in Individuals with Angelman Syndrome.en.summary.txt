**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents new data on adaptive functioning in individuals with Angelman syndrome using the Vineland-3, a caregiver-report measure of everyday skills. The speaker shows how adaptive skills change over time, how they differ by molecular subtype (deletion vs non-deletion), and why these findings matter for therapies, services, and clinical trial design. A closing commentary emphasizes that although subtypes differ statistically, all individuals with Angelman syndrome have severe, lifelong adaptive challenges compared with neurotypical peers.

### 1. What adaptive behavior is and why it matters in Angelman syndrome

- **Adaptive behavior** means the everyday skills needed to function as independently as possible: communication, self-care (eating, toileting, hygiene, dressing), household tasks, managing routines, social interaction, and motor skills. These are not test scores in isolation; they are the practical abilities that determine quality of life for both the individual and their caregivers. Individuals with Angelman syndrome have significant deficits in adaptive behavior, which strongly affect daily life and long-term independence. Because of this, adaptive behavior is a key **therapeutic target**—improvements here are what families and clinicians care about most. Understanding how these skills develop over time helps set realistic expectations, plan services, and design meaningful endpoints for clinical trials.

### 2. The Vineland-3 and key adaptive domains studied

- The **Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Third Edition (Vineland-3)** is a gold-standard, caregiver-reported measure of adaptive functioning, widely used in research and clinical trials. It assesses four main domains: **Communication**, **Daily Living Skills**, **Socialization**, and **Motor Skills**. In this study, the focus is on:  
  - Receptive communication (understanding language)  
  - Expressive communication (using sounds, gestures, words, including AAC)  
  - Personal daily living skills (toileting, hygiene, dressing, eating)  
  - Interpersonal relationships (early social behavior, imitation, recognizing/expressing emotions)  
  - Gross motor (using arms/legs for movement) and fine motor (using hands/fingers to manipulate objects).  
- The Vineland-3 improved on the Vineland-2 by adding more early-skill items, changing scoring, and explicitly accounting for **AAC (augmentative and alternative communication)** in expressive communication, which is crucial for Angelman syndrome. This makes Vineland-3 more sensitive and appropriate for this population and for current clinical trials.

### 3. Study design, participants, and data sources

- The study included **331 individuals** with Angelman syndrome; just under two-thirds had a **deletion** subtype, and the rest had **non-deletion** subtypes (UBEA3 mutation, UPD, or imprinting center defect). Ages at first visit ranged from **6 months to over 50 years**, with an average around 11 years; at last visit, the average age was about 12.5 years, and participants had on average **two Vineland-3 visits** (range 1–6). Caregivers completed the comprehensive Vineland-3 interview as part of:  
  - The Angelman Syndrome Natural History Study (FRI/“Friezia”),  
  - The Brain Development Study in Mark Shen’s lab (UNC),  
  - The UNC clinic.  
- All these data were contributed to the **LADDER database**, which the team used for this analysis. The broad age range and repeated measures allowed the researchers to examine how adaptive skills change across the lifespan and by molecular subtype.

### 4. Methods: growth scale values and modeling change over time

- The team used **mixed-effects models** with restricted maximum likelihood estimation to analyze change over time, which allows them to handle repeated assessments from the same person and different numbers of visits per participant. They modeled **Vineland Growth Scale Values (GSVs)** in relation to the **natural log of age** and molecular subtype; using log(age) captures the pattern of **faster gains early in life** and **slower gains later**, which matches real developmental trajectories.  
- **Growth Scale Values (GSVs)** are:  
  - Derived directly from raw scores,  
  - **Not age-normed**, so they show absolute skill level rather than how a child compares to age peers,  
  - On an **equal-interval scale**, meaning a 1-point change has the same meaning anywhere on the scale.  
- Because GSVs are not age-normed and don’t “floor out” as quickly as standard scores, they can detect **subtle within-person changes** even when standard scores are very low or flat. This makes them especially useful in Angelman syndrome, where many individuals score at or near the floor on standard measures.

### 5. Results by domain and molecular subtype

- **Receptive communication:** Individuals with **non-deletion** subtypes (UBEA3 mutation, UPD, imprinting center defect) had **higher overall skill levels** than those with deletions, but the **rate of growth over time was similar** across subtypes (their trajectories were roughly parallel).  
- **Expressive communication:** Non-deletion groups again had higher skill levels, and here the **rate of growth was steeper** in non-deletion compared with deletion, especially early in development—indicating faster early gains in expressive skills (including AAC use) in non-deletion subtypes.  
- **Personal daily living skills:** Non-deletion subtypes showed higher levels of self-care skills, and the **UBEA3 mutation group** in particular had a **steeper early growth rate** than the deletion group, suggesting faster acquisition of toileting, dressing, hygiene, and eating skills in early years.  
- **Interpersonal relationships:** Non-deletion subtypes had higher skill levels, but **growth rates did not differ significantly** between subtypes; again, trajectories were parallel, indicating similar patterns of social skill development over time.  
- **Gross and fine motor:** For both, non-deletion groups had higher overall motor skills than deletion, but **no significant differences in growth rate** were found; all groups showed ongoing motor skill gains, with similar-shaped trajectories.

### 6. Overall interpretation: growth patterns and need for ongoing services

- Across domains, the pattern is **faster gains early in development** followed by **slower, but continuing, gains later**; skills do not plateau completely, but the rate of change decreases with age. Individuals with non-deletion subtypes consistently show **higher levels of adaptive skills** than those with deletions, and in some domains (notably expressive communication and personal daily living skills) they also show **faster early growth**.  
- Importantly, **all subtypes** show **growth in all adaptive domains** over time—communication, daily living, social, and motor skills continue to improve. This supports the **need for continued services** across the lifespan: speech therapy (including AAC), occupational therapy, physical therapy, and educational/academic modifications.  
- The data argue against withdrawing services in older children or adults on the assumption that “they’re done developing”; instead, they justify **ongoing intervention** to support sustained development.

### 7. Future directions: seizures and other factors

- The next planned analyses will examine **how seizures affect the development of adaptive skills**, recognizing that seizure burden and control may influence learning and day-to-day functioning. The team also plans to investigate **other factors** that might affect adaptive skill levels and growth, such as medical comorbidities, behavioral issues, or environmental supports.  
- These future studies aim to identify **modifiable factors** that could be targeted to improve outcomes and to refine expectations for different clinical profiles. Understanding these influences will further inform both **clinical care** and **trial design** (e.g., stratifying by seizure history).

### 8. Perspective on deletion vs non-deletion severity and implications for trials

- Alison emphasizes that while the study carefully separates **deletion vs non-deletion** (and even UPD vs imprinting center defect vs mutation), these differences are **small when viewed against neurotypical development**. If you “zoom out” and compare any Angelman subtype to age-matched neurotypical peers, the gap is **huge**, and the differences between Angelman subtypes become relatively minor.  
- All Angelman subtypes are **severely affected**: regardless of genotype, individuals are non-verbal or minimally verbal, will not live independently, and have significant challenges with self-care, fine motor, and gross motor skills. While statistical analyses can detect subtype differences, these should not be misinterpreted as some subtypes being “mild” or not needing intervention.  
- For **industry partners and trial designers**, the key message is that **all genotypes are profoundly impacted** and all are appropriate targets for treatment; focusing only on deletion because it appears “more severe” misses the reality that non-deletion groups are also very severely affected. Trial design should recognize both the **shared severity across subtypes** and the **subtle differences** that may matter for analysis, without excluding or deprioritizing any group.
