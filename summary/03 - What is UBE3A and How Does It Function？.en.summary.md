**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
The talk explains what UBE3A is, how it functions inside neurons, and why its loss causes such wide-ranging problems in Angelman syndrome. The speaker walks through basic cell biology (proteins, degradation, and the proteasome), defines UBE3A as a specific type of enzyme (an E3 ligase), shows how its known targets affect brain function, and introduces emerging “molecular glue” technologies that might one day compensate for missing UBE3A.

## 1. Neurons and the role of proteins

- Neurons (brain and nerve cells) are the core units of the nervous system, responsible for sensing the world and controlling behavior.  
- Inside neurons are thousands of different **proteins**, which are the actual “workers” that carry out nearly all cellular functions (signaling, structure, communication, etc.).  
- Scientists can label these proteins with fluorescent tags, creating colorful images that show where different proteins are located in neurons.  
- The key idea: neurons don’t just “exist” and work on their own—**proteins inside them do the work**, and changing protein levels or function changes how neurons behave.  
- Understanding UBE3A requires first understanding that it is one of many proteins that help control other proteins inside neurons.

## 2. Protein production, folding, and degradation (protein homeostasis)

- Proteins are **made** (synthesized) in cells from genetic instructions (DNA → RNA → protein), then **folded** into specific 3D shapes that allow them to function.  
- Over time, proteins can become damaged, misfolded, or simply no longer needed, and cells must **remove** them; this removal is called **protein degradation**.  
- The balance between making new proteins and degrading old ones is called **protein homeostasis**—cells work hard to keep this balance tightly regulated.  
- If protein levels are too high or too low, or if damaged proteins accumulate, cell function (including neuron function) can be disrupted.  
- UBE3A is part of the machinery that decides **which proteins should be removed**, and when, to maintain this homeostasis.

## 3. The proteasome: the cell’s “trash can” for proteins

- The **proteasome** is a large protein complex in cells that breaks down unwanted proteins into small pieces; it’s often called the cell’s “trash can” or “shredder.”  
- Structurally, it looks like a barrel with a central hole; proteins to be destroyed are unfolded and fed through this hole, where they are chopped up.  
- The barrel core does the cutting, while “caps” on the ends help recognize, unfold, and feed in the target proteins.  
- Proteasomes are present throughout neurons (in the cell body, processes, and even near synapses) and are essential for normal neuronal activity.  
- When scientists chemically inhibit the proteasome, neuron activity changes quickly and negatively, showing that **ongoing protein degradation is critical for neuron function**.

---

## 4. The ubiquitin–proteasome system and where UBE3A fits (E3 ligase)

- The proteasome cannot decide on its own which proteins to destroy; it relies on a **tagging system** called the **ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)**.  
- In the UPS, a small protein called **ubiquitin** is attached to target proteins through a sequence of enzymes: **E1 (activating enzyme), E2 (conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ligase)**.  
- The **E3 ligase** is the key “decider”: it recognizes specific target proteins (called **substrates**) and helps attach ubiquitin to them, marking them for degradation.  
- **UBE3A is one of about 600 E3 ligases in the human genome**, each with its own set of preferred substrates; UBE3A does not tag all proteins, only certain ones.  
- In neurons, UBE3A’s job is to **tag specific proteins with ubiquitin so the proteasome can remove them**, which is normally beneficial and necessary for healthy neuron function.

## 5. UBE3A in neurons and its substrates as drivers of disease

- Neurons are structurally complex: they have a cell body (soma), a nucleus, and long processes (axons and dendrites), and **proteins are distributed throughout all these regions**.  
- UBE3A and proteasomes are present in many parts of the neuron, including the nucleus and the processes, but the **actual substrates** (the proteins they act on) can differ by location.  
- When UBE3A is disrupted (as in Angelman syndrome), the proteins it normally regulates can become **too abundant or improperly controlled**, leading to dysfunction in multiple neuronal compartments.  
- Other E3 ligases, when mutated, also cause neurodevelopmental disorders, underscoring that **precise control of protein degradation is central to brain development and function**.  
- A major research question is: **Which specific UBE3A substrates are most important for the symptoms of Angelman syndrome?**

## 6. A specific UBE3A substrate example: Fexin 5 (E5) and rescue in animal models

- During his postdoctoral work, the speaker identified a protein called **Fexin 5 (E5)** as a UBE3A substrate with a special role in neurons.  
- In experiments with fluorescently labeled neurons, removing Fexin 5 led to **many more contacts** between neurons, which might sound good but actually reflects abnormal connectivity.  
- Developmental time-course experiments showed that Fexin 5 levels **naturally decrease** as neurons mature, and this decrease is due to **proteasome-mediated degradation**.  
- Further work showed that **UBE3A is the E3 ligase that tags Fexin 5 for degradation**; when UBE3A is missing (as in Angelman models), Fexin 5 levels are abnormally high.  
- Importantly, in animal models lacking UBE3A, **reducing Fexin 5 levels partially restored synaptic contacts and improved cognitive-like behaviors**, supporting the idea that misregulated substrates contribute to Angelman phenotypes and can be therapeutic targets.

## 7. Large-scale discovery of UBE3A substrates

- To move beyond single examples like Fexin 5, the lab used **protein microarrays**: glass slides printed with ~20,000 different human proteins.  
- They incubated these arrays with the ubiquitination machinery (E1, E2, UBE3A, and ubiquitin) to see which proteins could be **ubiquitinated by UBE3A in vitro**.  
- The results, visualized as heat maps, showed that **UBE3A can potentially act on many different proteins**, indicating a broad substrate range.  
- However, just because a protein can be ubiquitinated on a slide does not mean it is a major substrate in real neurons; further analysis and prioritization (including computational/AI methods) are needed.  
- This large-scale approach provides a **starting list of candidate substrates** that can be cross-checked against brain expression, known disease links, and pathways relevant to Angelman syndrome.

## 8. Why UBE3A’s many targets matter for Angelman syndrome and treatment strategies

- Many candidate UBE3A substrates are **highly expressed in the brain** and some are already associated with other neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting they are biologically important.  
- The diversity of these substrates helps explain why **loss of a single gene (UBE3A) can cause such a wide range of symptoms**—motor, cognitive, behavioral, and more.  
- From a treatment perspective, the most straightforward strategy is to **restore UBE3A itself**, because that would re-establish normal regulation across all its substrates at once.  
- However, understanding individual substrates (like Fexin 5) shows that **targeting specific downstream proteins can also improve function**, at least in animal models.  
- This dual view—replace UBE3A where possible, and understand key substrates for additional or backup strategies—guides how researchers think about therapy development and research priorities.

## 9. Molecular glues and redirecting other E3 ligases to UBE3A substrates

- Structural biology advances (including tools like AlphaFold) now allow scientists to **predict or determine the 3D structures** of UBE3A and its substrates, and how they bind.  
- This structural insight supports the design of **“molecular glues”**: small molecules that physically bring together an E3 ligase and a substrate that it would not normally target.  
- In principle, if UBE3A is missing, one could use a molecular glue to **recruit a different, still-present E3 ligase** to a problematic UBE3A substrate, sending that substrate to the proteasome anyway.  
- The speaker’s team at Johns Hopkins has built platforms to express many human proteins and E3 ligases, perform large-scale screens, and identify such molecular glues that induce targeted degradation.  
- This is early-stage, complex technology, but it demonstrates that **the protein-degradation system itself is “druggable”**, opening a possible future route to control specific UBE3A substrates even without restoring UBE3A.

## 10. Summary and implications for Angelman research and therapy

- Neurons rely on proteins to function, and those proteins must be **both made and selectively removed**; the proteasome handles removal, guided by ubiquitin tags.  
- **UBE3A is an E3 ligase** that tags specific proteins for degradation, and its loss in Angelman syndrome disrupts the normal regulation of many substrates across the neuron.  
- Experiments show that **altering individual UBE3A substrates** (like Fexin 5) can rescue aspects of neuronal and behavioral function in animal models, supporting the substrate-based disease model.  
- New technologies, including large-scale substrate mapping and molecular glues, suggest future ways to **manipulate protein degradation pathways** as potential therapies.  
- Overall, while replacing UBE3A remains the most direct and powerful strategy, understanding its complex network of targets is crucial for designing complementary treatments and for making informed decisions about which research directions may have the greatest impact for individuals with Angelman syndrome.
