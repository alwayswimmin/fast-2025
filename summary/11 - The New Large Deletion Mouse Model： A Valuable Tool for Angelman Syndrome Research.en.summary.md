**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk presents a new “large deletion” Angelman syndrome mouse model that more accurately reflects the majority of human Angelman cases, which involve a large deletion on chromosome 15 rather than a small UBE3A-only mutation. The speaker compares this new model to the traditional UBE3A knockout model using EEG, seizure, and sleep data, and then shows how a CRISPR-based therapy (STEP-RNP) can rescue many of these abnormalities even when given later in development. The findings have direct implications for how we design and time human clinical trials.

## 1. Rationale for a new large deletion Angelman mouse model

- The traditional Angelman mouse model deletes or mutates only **UBE3A** (often called the “UBE3A exon 2 deletion” or “UBE3A knockout” model), which mirrors only about **10%** of Angelman patients who have small, intragenic UBE3A mutations.  
- In contrast, **>70%** of Angelman syndrome patients have a **large deletion** on chromosome **15q11–q13**, which removes UBE3A plus many neighboring genes.  
- To better capture this majority, the team created a **new mouse model** with a **6 megabase (Mb) deletion** on the **maternal chromosome**, analogous to the common human large deletion genotype.  
- This model is designed to more closely match the **typical clinical presentation** of Angelman syndrome, including more severe neurological features.  
- The goal is to understand the **full genetic contribution** of the 15q11–q13 region and to test therapies in a system that better reflects what most patients actually have.

## 2. EEG and seizure characteristics in the large deletion vs. UBE3A-only knockout mice

- The team implanted **wireless EEG transmitters** in mice, with:  
  - Two **EEG leads** on the skull to capture cortical brain activity, and  
  - Two **EMG leads** in the trapezius muscles to monitor muscle tone.  
- This setup allowed them to detect **seizure-like events** (spike trains) and distinguish them from normal activity and sleep stages.  
- In **wild-type** mice, EEG showed a stable baseline across frequency bands, representing normal brain activity; in contrast, **large deletion mice** had **many more spike trains**, especially at night, indicating higher seizure susceptibility.  
- **UBE3A knockout mice** also had increased spike activity compared to wild-type, but **far fewer and milder** events than the large deletion mice (roughly one short 1–2 second event every ~12 hours).  
- Measures of seizure severity—**spike duration** and **spikes per second**—were **highest in the large deletion mice**, moderate in UBE3A knockouts, and lowest in wild-type, showing that the large deletion model has a more severe seizure phenotype.

## 3. Sleep architecture and fragmentation in the two Angelman models

- Both **large deletion** and **UBE3A knockout** mice **slept more at night** than wild-type controls, and all groups had similar daytime napping, but the **quality** of nighttime sleep differed.  
- Large deletion mice had the **longest “resting wake” periods**—they were awake but not fully alert—indicating **lighter, less restorative sleep**; both mutant lines had **shorter active wake periods**, especially the large deletion mice.  
- When broken down by sleep stage:  
  - **Slow-wave sleep (deep sleep)** was **more disrupted** in large deletion mice.  
  - **Paradoxical sleep** (REM-like sleep) was altered in both models, likely influenced by nighttime seizure events.  
- Both mutant lines showed **frequent transitions between sleep stages at night**, a hallmark of **fragmented sleep**, whereas wild-type mice had **stable, consolidated sleep**.  
- During the **daytime**, sleep architecture was more similar across groups, and UBE3A knockout mice were even slightly more alert, suggesting that the most severe fragmentation occurs at night in the large deletion model.

## 4. EEG power spectrum changes and comparison to human Angelman EEG signatures

- The team analyzed the **EEG power spectrum**, which breaks brain activity into frequency bands:  
  - **Delta** (slow waves, deep sleep/abnormal slowing),  
  - **Alpha**, **sigma**, and **beta** (faster rhythms associated with wakefulness, attention, and normal cortical processing).  
- In wild-type mice, there was a normal balance: clear delta, alpha, and beta activity; in **large deletion mice**, **delta power was dramatically increased**, while **alpha and beta power were markedly reduced**.  
- Quantitatively, **increased delta power** was **significant only in the large deletion mice**, not in the UBE3A knockouts.  
- Both models showed **reduced alpha, sigma, and beta power**, but the reduction was **more pronounced** in the large deletion mice.  
- This pattern—**high delta, low alpha/beta**—matches the **characteristic EEG signature seen in Angelman syndrome patients**, indicating that the large deletion model more faithfully reproduces human EEG abnormalities than the UBE3A-only model.

## 5. STEP-RNP (CRISPR-based) treatment in the large deletion model: effects on seizures, sleep, and EEG

- The team applied their **STEP-RNP** therapy, a **CRISPR-based gene-editing approach** designed to reactivate or correct **UBE3A**, to the **large deletion mice** at two ages:  
  - **Postnatal day 1 (P1)** – newborn, and  
  - **Postnatal day 21 (P21)** – roughly adolescent/teenage in mouse terms.  
- EEGs were recorded at **6 months** and **1 year** of age to assess long-term effects.  
- STEP-RNP treatment **significantly reduced seizure susceptibility** in both P1 and P21 groups: spike train **frequency, duration, and spikes per second** were all reduced, indicating fewer and milder seizure-like events, and these improvements persisted to 1 year.  
- For sleep, treatment **reduced resting wake** and **paradoxical sleep duration**, and **increased active wake and slow-wave sleep**, leading to **more consolidated, higher-quality sleep** by 6 months; by 1 year, P1-treated mice had **slow-wave sleep extended to wild-type levels** despite aging.  
- EEG rhythms normalized:  
  - **Delta power** (the key biomarker of abnormal slowing) was significantly reduced; P1-treated mice matched wild-type delta by 6 months, and P21-treated mice reached wild-type delta by 1 year.  
  - **Alpha power** increased significantly in both groups, with P1-treated mice fully restored to wild-type levels and P21-treated mice sometimes even exceeding wild-type alpha during the day, suggesting enhanced cortical synchronization.

## 6. Overall significance of the large deletion model for Angelman research and therapy development

- The large deletion mouse model shows **higher seizure susceptibility**, **more disrupted sleep architecture**, and **distinct EEG power changes** that closely mirror those seen in **human Angelman patients with large deletions**.  
- In contrast, the traditional UBE3A-only knockout model **misses** some of these broader, more severe phenotypes, especially the strong delta increase and seizure burden.  
- Because the large deletion model includes **all the genes** typically deleted in human 15q11–q13 large deletions, it allows researchers to study the **combined effects** of UBE3A loss plus neighboring genes.  
- The fact that **correcting only UBE3A** with STEP-RNP in this more severe model **rescued most phenotypes** suggests that UBE3A remains the **central therapeutic target**, even when other genes are missing.  
- This model therefore provides a **more clinically relevant platform** for testing future therapies under conditions that better match the majority of Angelman patients.

## 7. New AS-UPD mouse model and future directions

- Beyond the large deletion model, the team has now generated the **first AS-UPD mouse model**, which carries:  
  - A **6 Mb deletion on the maternal chromosome**, and  
  - A **6 Mb duplication on the paternal chromosome**,  
  mimicking the **uniparental disomy (UPD)** form of Angelman syndrome.  
- This idea came directly from **family questions**: if we can model and treat large deletions, what about **UPD and imprinting center defects (ICD)**?  
- The AS-UPD model is intended to capture the **different gene dosage and imprinting patterns** seen in UPD/ICD patients, who may have different symptom profiles from large deletion patients.  
- The team is currently performing **baseline behavioral testing** on this new model to characterize its phenotype.  
- Future work will likely compare **treatment responses** (e.g., to STEP-RNP) between large deletion and UPD-like models to see whether **non-UBE3A genes** change how well therapies work.

## 8. Moderator’s closing interpretation and implications for clinical trials

- The moderator emphasizes that the **large deletion model is more severely impaired** than the traditional UBE3A-only knockout, yet **editing only UBE3A** with CRISPR **corrected almost all measured phenotypes**.  
- This suggests that, at least in this model, it may be **hard to separate** the contributions of non-UBE3A genes from UBE3A itself in terms of treatment response, because UBE3A correction is so powerful.  
- Importantly, the data show that **newborn (P1) and adolescent (P21) mice** both experience **substantial rescue**, and that **benefits in older mice continue to improve over time** (from 6 months to 1 year).  
- Translating to humans, this supports the idea that **older children, adolescents, and adults can still benefit**, but **may need more time** to show the full effect of treatment.  
- For clinical trials, this argues strongly that we **should not end trials too early**, because the **best benefits may emerge gradually**, especially in older participants—an important consideration for designing trial duration and follow-up.
