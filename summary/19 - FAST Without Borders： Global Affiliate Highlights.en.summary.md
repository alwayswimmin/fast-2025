### 2. FAST Australia

- FAST Australia’s chairperson, Shane, reports that 2025 was a major year, highlighted by “Huxley’s Heroes,” where Mitch ran 1,100 km in 27 days (about a marathon a day) from Broken Hill to Newcastle.  
- This run captured national attention, significantly raising awareness of Angelman syndrome and raising $160,000 for FAST Australia.  
- They held a biannual collaborative conference in Sydney with the Australian partner organization ASA: one day focused on science and one day on practical education for AS parents, followed by a gala that raised over $180,000.  
- For 2026, they aim to host phase 3 clinical trials in Australia and expand their AS clinic program by funding clinical nurses in Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney to improve access to expert care.  
- They are also preparing to launch the Global Angelman Syndrome Registry 2.0, addressing past challenges and aiming for a more effective global data resource.

**Key Takeaways / Actionable Points (≤5 sentences)**  
- High-visibility fundraising events (like extreme runs) can both raise substantial funds and dramatically increase public awareness.  
- Combining scientific conferences with parent-focused education and fundraising galas is an effective integrated model for community engagement.  
- Investing in clinical nurse positions at AS clinics improves ongoing access to specialized care and supports trial readiness.  
- A robust, updated Global Angelman Syndrome Registry (2.0) will be a key tool for research and trial recruitment; families should be prepared to participate when it launches.  
- Other regions can replicate Australia’s model of combining media-worthy events, structured conferences, and clinical infrastructure building.

### 3. FAST France

- Charlotte Pa, Vice President of FAST France, highlights two main achievements: mapping the French AS community and launching their first research project.  
- The community map includes nearly 200 registered families and is an interactive, business-intelligence–style tool that can be filtered by age, genotype, and region, helping trial sites recruit participants more quickly and showcasing the community to pharmaceutical companies.  
- This mapping approach is being replicated in other countries to bring the global AS community into clearer focus for researchers and industry.  
- FAST France’s first funded research project is an eye-tracking study to assess whether eye-tracking can be a robust tool to measure social perception challenges in Angelman syndrome by tracking where children look while watching videos.  
- For 2026, they are planning two new research projects: one on tau protein as a potential biomarker for experimental treatments, and another on e-health tools to measure children’s sleep difficulties at home.

**Key Takeaways / Actionable Points (≤5 sentences)**  
- A detailed, filterable community map is a powerful tool for faster clinical trial recruitment and for demonstrating to industry that a ready patient population exists.  
- Eye-tracking is being explored as an objective measure of social perception, which could become a useful outcome measure in trials.  
- Biomarkers like tau protein and digital health tools for sleep monitoring can provide more precise, continuous data about AS symptoms and treatment effects.  
- Other affiliates can adopt similar mapping and e-health strategies to strengthen their research infrastructure.  
- Families are encouraged to register in such maps and participate in studies to make their community more visible and trial-ready.

- FAST UK continues to fund the natural history study in Oxford, now extended for another two years; this study has been crucial in bringing clinical trials to the UK by documenting how Angelman syndrome progresses over time.  
- They host an annual event at Alton Towers around International Angelman Day, which brings families together, raises awareness, and drives fundraising, with participation growing each year.  
- FAST UK ran national media campaigns across radio, newspapers, and TV around International Angelman Day and International Carers Week, and launched a caregiver survey to gather key information and reach more families.  
- They are active in broader rare disease advocacy, including Genetic Alliance UK, newborn screening expansion discussions, and regulatory reform, and have added a trustee, Sarah Washbrook, who is influential in disability law and rare disease regulatory processes.

**Key Takeaways / Actionable Points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Natural history studies are foundational for clinical trials because they define baseline disease progression and help regulators evaluate treatment effects.  
- Large family events and media campaigns are effective for raising awareness, building community, and recruiting new supporters and fundraisers.  
- Caregiver surveys provide critical real-world data on burden and needs, which can inform policy, clinical care, and trial design.  
- Engagement with national alliances and regulatory bodies helps ensure AS is considered in newborn screening and rare disease policy.

### 7. FAST Spain

- Cesario Guyana Duran, from the scientific committee of FAST Spain, reports that 2025 was a very strong year for Angelman research in Spain.  
- They secured a government-funded molecular lab for the first time, brought two private universities together in one project, and then expanded that project to include three leading Italian rare disease institutions, creating a multi-country collaboration.  
- FAST Spain launched its second research grant with a €100,000 endowment, and is working to get all involved institutions talking and collaborating effectively.  
- On the fundraising side, families raised over €35,000 in the first half of the year through family-organized events, and FAST Spain began participating in corporate social responsibility (CSR) grant programs, winning their first and pursuing more.  
- For 2026, they plan to have at least three active projects (a natural history study, a dental/teeth-related project, and a biomarker project) and possibly a fourth, while aiming for a record fundraising year by expanding corporate grants.

**Key Takeaways / Actionable Points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Securing government and university partnerships, including international collaborations, significantly strengthens a country’s research capacity.  
- Competitive research grants (e.g., €100,000) attract high-quality projects and foster innovation in areas like biomarkers and natural history.  
- Family-led fundraising remains vital, but adding CSR grants from companies diversifies and stabilizes funding sources.  
- A portfolio of projects (natural history, dental health, biomarkers) addresses multiple aspects of AS care and research simultaneously.

- Kolina Kamaruk, Chairperson of FAST Poland, reports that 2025 was a breakthrough year: for the first time, clinical trials of a potential Angelman therapy began in Poland.  
- This was made possible by strong collaboration among medical experts, industry partners, and the AS community, allowing Polish families to participate directly in global research.  
- FAST Poland, together with the Medical University of Poznań, launched the first national “cost of living with Angelman syndrome” study, documenting the burden on families, caregivers, the healthcare system, and society.  
- This cost-of-illness data will be a powerful advocacy tool when therapies are approved, helping to argue for access and reimbursement.  
- They also held a conference titled “Between Dreams and Reality” for International Angelman Day, bringing together experts, parents, and therapists to share knowledge and hope, and plan to continue advocacy and awareness efforts in 2026 so no family faces AS alone.

**Key Takeaways / Actionable Points (≤5 sentences)**  
- Starting local clinical trials is a major milestone that requires coordinated effort among clinicians, industry, and families.
