**High-level overview (2–3 sentences)**  
This talk explains why accurately measuring the protein UBE3A in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is critical for developing and dosing therapies for Angelman syndrome. The speaker describes the challenges of detecting such tiny amounts of UBE3A, compares different assay types, and presents a newly developed, ultra-sensitive “gold standard” assay that can quantify UBE3A in CSF at extremely low levels. The assay is now being used to answer key biological questions and is being made available to researchers and therapeutic developers.

### Speaker introduction

- **Name:** Dr. Morty Razavi  
- **Background & experience:** Dr. Razavi has spent roughly 20 years working on protein biomarkers, having developed or worked with an estimated 200–300 different protein biomarker assays.  
- **Expertise:** Protein biomarker assay development, with a particular focus on highly sensitive measurements of proteins in biological fluids.  
- **Connection to UBE3A/Angelman syndrome:** He describes UBE3A as a “master protein” in neurons and notes a personal, emotional connection to this target because of its central role in brain function and its importance in Angelman syndrome therapies.  
- **Affiliations:** He speaks on behalf of a company specializing in biomarker assay development (name not specified in the transcript) that has partnered with FAST (Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics) under the leadership of Allison and Jennifer to develop a UBE3A CSF assay.

## 1. Why measuring UBE3A is essential for Angelman syndrome therapies

- UBE3A is described as a “master protein” in neurons, crucial for proper brain and cellular function, and central to Angelman syndrome because patients lack sufficient functional UBE3A in neurons.  
- Regardless of the therapeutic approach (gene therapy, antisense oligonucleotides, other modalities), the core question is: are you actually restoring UBE3A in neurons, and at what levels?  
- Measuring UBE3A helps answer three key therapeutic questions: (1) Are you delivering the protein to the right place (neurons)? (2) How much UBE3A is present after treatment (to guide dosing)? (3) Does the restored UBE3A persist over time (long-term effect)?  
- Longitudinal measurement—repeated measurements over time—is needed to see whether therapeutic effects are sustained or fade.  
- Actionable point: any clinical development program for Angelman syndrome should plan to include a robust UBE3A measurement strategy as a pharmacodynamic and dose-optimization biomarker.

## 2. Types of assays used to measure UBE3A and their limitations

- **Protein assays:** These directly measure the UBE3A protein, which is the functional molecule of interest and thus the most appropriate biomarker. However, UBE3A levels in CSF are extremely low, making sensitivity a major challenge and raising concerns about whether existing assays truly detect the correct protein.  
- **RNA assays:** These measure RNA (the gene’s product before it becomes protein), which can be easier to detect, but RNA levels do not guarantee that the protein is actually produced or present at functional levels.  
- **Tissue-based assays:** These can visualize UBE3A in brain tissue and are powerful for localization (seeing where the protein is), but brain tissue is not practical or ethical to obtain in clinical trials.  
- Because of these limitations, there is a strong need for an assay that can measure UBE3A protein directly in a feasible clinical sample—CSF—serving as a surrogate for brain tissue.  
- Actionable point: researchers and companies should prioritize protein-level assays in accessible fluids (like CSF) over relying solely on RNA or tissue-based measurements for clinical decision-making.

## 3. Development of a highly sensitive “gold standard” UBE3A CSF assay

- With funding and leadership from FAST (Allison and Jennifer), Dr. Razavi’s team began developing a highly sensitive UBE3A protein assay for CSF about 18 months prior to the talk.  
- The goal was to create a “gold standard” assay: one that is sensitive, specific, and robust enough to quantify UBE3A in CSF from Angelman syndrome patients, where levels are extremely low.  
- The team has successfully developed this assay and has already used it to measure UBE3A in real CSF samples from individuals with Angelman syndrome.  
- This assay is designed specifically to support ongoing and future clinical trials by providing reliable quantitative data on UBE3A protein levels.  
- Actionable point: clinical trial designers and therapeutic developers can now incorporate this validated CSF UBE3A assay into their study protocols to monitor treatment effects.

## 4. Sensitivity achieved and what it means in practical terms

- The assay can detect UBE3A in CSF at **femtogram per milliliter** levels (10⁻¹⁵ grams per milliliter), which is extraordinarily low.  
- To explain this to a lay audience, Dr. Razavi compares it to seeing a bee on a flower on a lily pad in a pond from the vantage point of the International Space Station, using only your naked eyes—illustrating the extreme sensitivity.  
- Such sensitivity is necessary because UBE3A is present at very low concentrations in CSF, especially in Angelman syndrome patients.  
- High sensitivity reduces the risk of false negatives (missing real UBE3A) and allows for more precise quantification across a range of low levels.  
- Actionable point: this level of sensitivity enables detection of even modest increases in UBE3A after therapy, which is crucial for early-phase trials and dose-finding studies.

## 5. Future applications: biological questions and broad access to the assay

- With the assay now available, the next step is to use it to answer important biological questions, such as whether UBE3A in CSF is truly neuronal in origin.  
- The team is collaborating with the broader community to obtain appropriate sample types, including age-matched neurotypical CSF samples, to compare and better understand UBE3A biology.  
- As a company, they are working to make the assay **commercially available** to any group developing Angelman syndrome therapeutics or conducting related research.  
- This open access approach means that any researcher who needs to measure UBE3A in CSF can use the same standardized, high-quality assay, improving comparability across studies.  
- Actionable point: researchers and companies working on Angelman syndrome should contact the assay provider to integrate this tool into their research, enabling consistent measurement of UBE3A across different therapeutic approaches and studies.
